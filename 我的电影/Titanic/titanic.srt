1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:19,360


2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,360


3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:39,360


4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:51,360


5
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:02,360


6
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,660
13 meters. You should see it.

7
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,720
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

8
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,520
Mir 2, we're going over the bow. Stay with us.

9
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,720
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

10
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,520
Seeing her coming out of the darkness like a ghost ship...

11
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,440
still gets me every time.

12
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,020
To see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here...

13
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,690
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning

14
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
of April 15, 1912...

15
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,530
after her long fall...

16
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,330
from the world above.

17
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,410
You are so full of shit, boss.

18
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,610
Dive 6. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

19
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,910
21/2 miles down. 3,821 meters.

20
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,250
The pressure outside is 31/2 tons per square inch.

21
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,750
These windows are 9 inches thick.

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,670
If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.

23
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,630
All right, enough of that bullshit.

24
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,980
Just put her down on the roof of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

25
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,950
Mir 2, we're landing right over the Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?

26
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,700
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now. Go, Charlie.

27
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,630
- All right, tether out.  - Tether out.

28
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,510
Okay, Brock, we're dropping down along the hull.

29
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,140
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down and go into the first class gangway door.

30
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,060
I want you guys working the D deck...

31
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,680
reception area and the dining saloon.

32
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Copy that.

33
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,860
- Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left.  - Okay, coming left.

34
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,710
Snoop Dog is on the move. We're headed down the stairwell.

35
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,300
Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.

36
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,130
- Okay, A deck.  - Give me some rope, Captain.

37
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,970
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

38
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,590
Watch the door frame.

39
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,430
- Watch it, watch it.  - I see it. I got it.

40
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,850
- We good? Bring her down.  - We're good. Just chill, boss.

41
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,450
Okay, make your turn.

42
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,200
- Cable out, Captain.  - Make your turn. Watch the wall.

43
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,830
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

44
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,960
Okay, copy that.

45
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,550
Okay, right there. Right there.

46
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,340
Okay, that's it, that's it. That's the bedroom door.

47
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,930
I see it. I see it.

48
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,110
We're in!

49
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
We're in, baby. We're there.

50
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,570
That's Hockley's bed.

51
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,820
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

52
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,330
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

53
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,080
Hold it. Hold it just a second. Go back to the right.

54
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,010
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

55
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,760
You smelling something, boss?

56
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,180
- I want to see what's under it.  - Give me my hands, man.

57
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,190
All right.

58
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,770
- Take it easy. It might come apart.  - Okay.

59
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,450
Go, go, go. Flip it over. Flip it over. Go.

60
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,320
Turn her over. Keep going.

61
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,780
Go, go, go.

62
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,200
Okay, drop it.

63
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,550
Oh, baby, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

64
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,470
It's payday, boys.

65
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,940
Cha-ching!

66
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,650
- We did it, Bobby.  - We brought it back, Baby.

67
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,990
Oh, yeah! Who's the best? Who's the best, baby?

68
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,330
Say it. Say it. Say it.

69
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,330
You are, Lewis.

70
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
- Bobby, my cigar.  - Right here.

71
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Okay, crack her open.

72
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Shit.

73
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,710
No diamond.

74
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,470
You know boss, this same thing happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

75
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,890
Turn the camera off.

76
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,720
Brock, the partners would like to know how it's going.

77
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,230
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't in the safe. But hey, hey...

78
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,070
Don't worry about it. There's still plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

79
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,690
The floor debris in the suite, the mother's room...

80
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,950
the purser's safe on C deck.

81
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

82
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,410
A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.

83
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,000
We've just got to go through a little process of elimination.

84
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,080
Hang on a second.

85
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,000
- Let me see that.  - Ah, we may have something here, guys.

86
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,510
Where's the photograph of the necklace?

87
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,590
We'll call you right back.

88
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,440
I'll be goddamned.

89
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,860
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold...

90
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,780
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

91
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.

92
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,290
He is with us live via satellite from the research ship Keldysh...

93
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,710
in the North Atlantic. Hello. Brock.

94
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,970
Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows the familiar stories of Titanic.

95
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,220
You know, the nobility of the band playing to the very end and all that.

96
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,970
But what I'm interested in are the untold stories. The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.

97
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,230
And we're out here using robot technology to go further into the wreck...

98
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,150
than anybody has ever done before.

99
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,650
Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy...

100
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,900
over salvage rights and even ethics. Many are calling you a graverobber.

101
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,990
Well, nobody ever called the recovery of the artifacts...

102
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
What is it?

103
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,160
Turn that up, dear.

104
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,160
I have museum-trained experts sent out here making sure...

105
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,080
that these relics are preserved and catalogued properly.

106
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,090
Take a look at this drawing that we found just today.

107
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,840
A piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years.

108
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,680
And my team are able to preserve it intact.

109
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,350
Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...

110
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
- when we can see and enjoy it now?  - I'll be goddamned.

111
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Brock!

112
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,360
There's a satellite call for you.

113
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,940
Bobby, we're launching. You see these submersibles going in the water?

114
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,610
Trust me, buddy. You want to take this call.

115
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,780
This better be good.

116
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,790
Now, you gotta speak up. She's kind of old.

117
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,200
Great.

118
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,460
This is Brock Lovett. How can I help you, Mrs...?

119
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,710
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

120
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Mrs. Calvert.

121
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,800
I was just wondering if you had found...

122
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,050
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

123
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,140
Told you you wanted to take the call.

124
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,390
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

125
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,980
Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is?

126
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

127
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,340
She's a goddamn liar! Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

128
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,420
God only knows why. Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

129
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,590
They're inbound!

130
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,520
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic when she was 17, right?

131
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,270
- That's right.  - If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

132
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,780
101 next month.

133
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,950
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

134
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
Look, I've already done the background on this woman...

135
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,450
all the way back to the 20s, when she was working as an actress.

136
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,620
An actress. There's your first clue, Sherlock.

137
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,250
Her name was Rose Dawson back then. Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

138
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,800
They move to Cedar Rapids and she punches out a couple of kids.

139
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,300
Now Calvert's dead and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

140
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,890
And everybody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead...

141
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
or on this boat, but she knows.

142
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,070
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

143
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,490
Hurry up, give him a hand.

144
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,910
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett. Welcome to the Keldysh.

145
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay, let's get her inside there.

146
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Hi, Miss Calvert.

147
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,750
- Hi.  - Welcome to the Keldysh.

148
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,840
Thanks.

149
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,510
Hey!

150
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,100
Are your staterooms all right?

151
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Oh, yes.

152
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,350
Very nice.

153
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

154
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,310
She takes care of me.

155
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,320
We met just a few minutes ago.

156
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,650
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

157
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,030
Oh, yes.

158
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,610
There. That's nice.

159
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,530
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

160
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Can I get you anything?

161
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,040
Is there anything you'd like?

162
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,790
Yes.

163
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,620
I would like to see my drawing.

164
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,390
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone that was...

165
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,180
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown...

166
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,150
which disappeared in 1792...

167
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,070
about the same time old Louis lost everything from the neck up.

168
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,150
The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped, too.

169
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,660
Recut into a heart-like shape that became known as...

170
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,870
the Heart of the Ocean.

171
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,740
Today it would be worth more than the Hope diamond.

172
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,160
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

173
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I only wore it this once.

174
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,090
You actually think this is you, Nana?

175
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,210
It is me, dear.

176
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,210
Wasn't I a dish?

177
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,930
I tracked it down through insurance records.

178
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,930
An old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy.

179
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,690
Can you tell me who the claimant was, Rose?

180
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,600
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

181
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,650
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

182
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,110
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

183
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,740
The claim was for a diamond necklace his son...

184
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,280
Caledon, bought his fiancee.

185
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
You.

186
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,370
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

187
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,700
And it was filed right after the sinking.

188
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,620
So the diamond had to have gone down with the ship.

189
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,210
You see the date?

190
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,710
April 14, 1912.

191
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,880
Which means if your grandmother is who she says she is...

192
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,800
she was wearing the diamond the day the Titanic sank.

193
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,180
And that makes you my new best friend.

194
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,180
These are some of the things we recovered from your stateroom.

195
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,570
This was mine.

196
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,900
How extraordinary.

197
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,990
And it looks the same as it did the last time I saw it.

198
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,250
The reflection has changed a bit.

199
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,430
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

200
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,190
Okay, here we go.

201
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,480
She hits the berg on the starboard side, right?

202
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,570
She kind of bumps along...

203
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,900
punching holes like morse code...

204
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,450
dit-dit-dit... along the side...

205
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,530
below the water line.

206
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,280
Then the forward compartments start to flood.

207
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,660
Now, as the water level rises...

208
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,660
it spills over the watertight bulkheads...

209
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,540
which, unfortunately, don't go any higher than E deck.

210
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,370
So now as the bow goes down...

211
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,130
the stern rises up, slow at first...

212
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,800
then faster and faster...

213
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,300
until finally, she's got her whole ass sticking up in the air.

214
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,340
And that's a big ass.

215
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,300
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

216
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,640
And the hull's not designed to deal with that pressure.

217
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,430
So, what happens?

218
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,600
She splits, right down to the keel.

219
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,690
And the stern...

220
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,150
falls back level.

221
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,230
Then...

222
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,310
as the bow sinks...

223
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,320
it pulls the stern vertical...

224
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,570
and then finally detaches.

225
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,660
Now the stern section just kind of bobs there like a cork for a couple of minutes...

226
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,080
floods, and finally goes under about 2:20 AM...

227
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,500
2 hours and 40 minutes after the collision.

228
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,330
The bow section planes away...

229
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,290
landing about a half a mile away...

230
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,380
going 20, 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor.

231
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,260
Pretty cool, huh?

232
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,850
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

233
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,020
Of course, the experience of it was...

234
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,520
somewhat different.

235
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Will you share it with us?

236
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm taking her to rest.

237
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
No.

238
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,410
Come on, Nana.

239
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,830
No!

240
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,590
Give me the tape recorder.

241
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,760
Tell us, Rose.

242
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,930
It's been 84 years...

243
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,060
It's okay. Just try to remember anything...

244
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,640
anything at all.

245
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,600
Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett?

246
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,610
It's been 84 years...

247
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,450
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

248
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,080
The china had never been used.

249
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,460
The sheets had never been slept in.

250
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,050
Titanic was called the ship of dreams.

251
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,720
And it was.

252
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,680
It really was.

253
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,420
All third-class passengers...

254
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,630
with a forward berth...

255
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,050
this way please! This queue!

256
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,090
It's a big boat, huh?

257
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,300
Daddy, it's a ship.

258
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,430
You're right.

259
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,420
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

260
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,050
It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.

261
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,960
You can be blase about some things, Rose...

262
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,880
but not about Titanic.

263
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,840
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania...

264
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,470
and far more luxurious.

265
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,760
Your daughter is far too difficult to impress, Ruth.

266
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,020
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.

267
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,140
It is unsinkable.

268
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,640
God Himself could not sink this ship...

269
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,770
What?!

270
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,360
You have to check your baggage through the main terminal.

271
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,650
It's round that way, sir.

272
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,480
I put my faith in you good sir.

273
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,690
Now kindly see my man.

274
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,030
Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

275
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,150
If I can do anything at all...

276
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,570
Yes, right.

277
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,820
All the trunks from that car there.

278
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,950
12 from here.

279
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,080
And the safe, to the parlor suite...

280
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,920
rooms B52, 54, 56.

281
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,250
Ladies...

282
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,090
we better hurry.

283
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
Come along.

284
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,140
- My coat?  - I have it, miss.

285
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,560
All third-class passengers queue here for health inspection.

286
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,240
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.  - Welcome to Titanic.

287
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,530
It was the ship of dreams...

288
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,990
to everyone else.

289
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,280
To me. It was a slave ship...

290
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,790
taking me back to America in chains.

291
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,790
Outwardly, I was everything a well brought up girl should be.

292
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,630
Inside, I was screaming.

293
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,400
Jack, you are pazzo.

294
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
You bet everything we have.

295
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,650
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.

296
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,650
You moron. I can't believe you bet our tickets.

297
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,120
Sven?

298
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,190
All right, moment of truth.

299
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,690
Someone's life is about to change.

300
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,060
Fabrizio?

301
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,530
Niente.

302
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Olaf?

303
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,860
Nothing.

304
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,370
Sven?

305
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,870
Uh-oh. 2 pair.

306
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

307
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,340
I'm sorry...

308
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,710
you're not gonna see your mom again for a long time.

309
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,470
'cause we're going to America.

310
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,840
Full house, boys!

311
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,230
Come on.

312
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,730
I'm going home!

313
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,160
I'm going home.

314
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,620
I go to America!

315
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,240
No, mate.

316
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,490
Titanic go to America,

317
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,080
in 5 minutes.

318
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,620
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

319
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,750
Come on, here. Here.

320
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,960
We're riding in high style now!

321
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,510
We're a couple of regular swells.

322
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,300
We're practically goddamn royalty...

323
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
ragazzo mio.

324
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,590
You see? Is my destino.

325
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,140
Like I told you...

326
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,970
I go to America to be millionaire.

327
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,350
You are pazzo.

328
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,190
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

329
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,520
Come on, I thought you were fast.

330
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,610
Aspetta!

331
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,610
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

332
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,690
Hey, wait!

333
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
We're passengers!

334
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,410
Have you been through the inspection queue?

335
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,490
Of course.

336
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,040
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

337
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,040
We're Americans. Both of us.

338
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Right.

339
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,210
Come aboard.

340
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,130
We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world.

341
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,170
You know that?

342
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,390
Good-bye!

343
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,480
You know somebody?

344
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,060
Of course not. That's not the point.

345
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,650
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

346
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,110
Good-bye!

347
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,280
I will never forget you!

348
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,490
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

349
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,370
G60.

350
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,040
G60. G60.

351
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,460
Excuse me, ma'am.

352
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,710
G60.

353
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,720
Oh, right here.

354
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,300
Hey, how you doing?

355
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,430
Jack. Nice to meet you.

356
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,220
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

357
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
How you doing?

358
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,730
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

359
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,730


360
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,480
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

361
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,860
Will you be requiring anything?

362
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,400
Excuse me.

363
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,490
- This one?  - No.

364
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,990
It had a lot of faces on it.

365
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,910
This is the one.

366
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,410
Would you like all of them out, miss?

367
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,920
Yes. We need a little color in this room.

368
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,960
Put in there. In the wardrobe.

369
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,180
God, not those finger paintings again.

370
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,840
They certainly were a waste of money.

371
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,930
The difference between Cal's taste in art...

372
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,600
and mine is that I have some.

373
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
They're fascinating.

374
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,190
Like being inside a dream or something.

375
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,770
There's truth but no logic.

376
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,860
- What's the artist's name?  - Something Picasso.

377
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,320
Something Picasso.

378
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,150
He won't amount to a thing.

379
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,490
He won't, trust me.

380
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,030
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.  - At least they were cheap.

381
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,620
Put it in the wardrobe.

382
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,460
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown.

383
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,460
We all called her Molly.

384
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,970
History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

385
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,430
Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny.

386
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,680
Here, if you think you can manage.

387
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,310
Her husband had struck gold someplace out west.

388
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,440
And she was what Mother called "new money."

389
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,940
By the next afternoon...

390
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,730
we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland...

391
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,110
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

392
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,500
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

393
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,620
Let's stretch her legs.

394
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Yes sir.

395
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,380
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

396
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,170
Very good, sir.

397
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
All ahead full.

398
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,890
All ahead full!

399
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,930
Come on lads, step lively!

400
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,580
All right! Let's stoke her right up!

401
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,990
We go full ahead!

402
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,330
Come on, put your backs into it!

403
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,930
21 knots, sir.

404
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
Hey, look, look, look!

405
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,440
See it?

406
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
There's another one! See him?

407
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,960
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

408
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,820
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

409
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,570
Very small, of course.

410
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm the king of the world!

411
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,050
She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man...

412
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
in all history.

413
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,760
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here...

414
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,720
designed her from the keel plates up.

415
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,930
I may have knocked her together, but...

416
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,180
the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

417
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,020
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale...

418
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,150
and so luxurious in...

419
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,270
its appointments...

420
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,480
that its supremacy would never be challenged.

421
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,150
And here she is.

422
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,700
- Willed into solid reality.  - Hear, hear.

423
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,410
I'll have the salmon.

424
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,910
You know I don't like that, Rose.

425
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,750
She knows.

426
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,090
We'll both have the lamb.

427
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,340
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

428
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,010
You like lamb, right sweet pea?

429
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,850
You gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?

430
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,270
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

431
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Was it you, Bruce?

432
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,610
Yes, actually.

433
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,610
I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability...

434
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,110
luxury, and above all, strength.

435
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,450
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

436
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,040
His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you.

437
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,790
What's gotten into you?

438
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,380
Excuse me.

439
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,300
I do apologize.

440
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,590
She's a pistol, Cal. Hope you can handle her.

441
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,220
Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

442
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,390
Freud? Who is he? Is he a passenger?

443
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,530
The ship is nice, huh?

444
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,530
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

445
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Is English, no?

446
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,790
No, it was built in Ireland.

447
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,700
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

448
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,540
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

449
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,210
That's typical.

450
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,380
First-class dogs come down here to take a shite.

451
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,170
Lets us know where we rank in the scheme of things.

452
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,050
Like we could forget?

453
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,890
I'm Tommy Ryan.

454
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,220
- Jack Dawson.  - Fabrizio.

455
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,850
Do you make any money with your drawings?

456
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,570
Ah, forget it, boyo.

457
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,910
You'd as like have angels fly out of your arse as get next to...

458
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,580
the likes of her.

459
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,940
I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it.

460
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,770
An endless parade of parties and cotillions...

461
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,110
yachts and polo matches.

462
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,450
Always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter.

463
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,790
I felt like I was standing at a great precipice...

464
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,620
with no one to pull me back. No one who cared...

465
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,130
or even noticed.

466
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Don't do it.

467
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,070
Stay back.

468
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Don't come any closer.

469
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,870
Come on.

470
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,330
Just give me your hand. I'll pull you back over.

471
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,750
No! Stay where you are.

472
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I mean it.

473
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,420
I'll let go.

474
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,930
No, you won't.

475
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,270
What do you mean, no I won't?

476
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,230
Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do.

477
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,440
You don't know me.

478
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,780
Well, you would have done it already.

479
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,610
You're distracting me. Go away.

480
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,110
I can't.

481
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,530
I'm involved now.

482
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,790
You let go, and I'm going to have to jump in there after you.

483
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,120
Don't be absurd.

484
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,620
- You'll be killed.  - I'm a good swimmer.

485
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,790
The fall alone will kill you.

486
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,300
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.

487
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,090
Tell you the truth...

488
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,220
I'm a lot more concerned about that water being so cold.

489
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,600
How cold?

490
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,150
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.

491
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,650
You ever, uh...

492
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,740
ever been to Wisconsin?

493
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,160
What?

494
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,660
Well, they have some of the coldest winters around.

495
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,830
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

496
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,840
I remember when I was a kid, me and my father, we went ice fishing...

497
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,000
out on Lake Wissota.

498
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,840
Ice fishing is, you know, where you...

499
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,760
I know what ice fishing is!

500
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,180
Sorry.

501
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,010
You just seem like, you know, kind of an indoor girl.

502
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,350
Anyway, I...

503
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,350
fell through some thin ice.

504
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,190
And I'm telling you...

505
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,190
water that cold,

506
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,190
like right down there...

507
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,320
it hits you like 1000 knives stabbing you all over your body.

508
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,160
You can't breathe.

509
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,670
You can't think. Least not about anything but the pain.

510
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,960
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in there after you.

511
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,050
Like I said...

512
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,550
I don't have a choice.

513
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,560
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll come back over the rail and...

514
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,060
and get me off the hook here.

515
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,230
You're crazy.

516
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,730
That's what everybody says but...

517
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,900
with all due respect, miss...

518
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,740
I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here.

519
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,910
Come on.

520
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,240
Come on, give me your hand.

521
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,410
You don't want to do this.

522
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,930
I'm Jack Dawson.

523
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,100
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

524
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,100
I'll have to get you to write that one down.

525
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,770
Come on.

526
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,070
I got you.

527
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,280
Come on.

528
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,080
Help, please!

529
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,960
Help!

530
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,460
- Please, help me!  - Listen. Listen to me.

531
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,130
Listen. Listen to me.

532
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,960
I've got you. I won't let go.

533
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

534
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Come on.

535
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,590
That's right.

536
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,220
You can do it.

537
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,480
I got you.

538
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,650
What's all this?

539
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,660
You stand back and...

540
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,410
don't move an inch!

541
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,870
Fetch the Master at Arms.

542
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,080
This is completely unacceptable!

543
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,000
What made you think that you could put your hands on my fiancee?!

544
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,840
Look at me, you filth!

545
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,170
Cal.

546
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,470
What do you think you were doing?

547
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,180
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

548
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,510
An accident?

549
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,180
It was.

550
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,350
Stupid, really.

551
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,690
I was leaning over and I slipped.

552
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,690
I was leaning far over to see the, uh...

553
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,360
uh, uh, the uh...

554
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,530
- Propellers?  - Propellers, and I slipped.

555
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,540
And I would have gone overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

556
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,040
saved me. And almost went over himself.

557
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,040
You wanted to see the... She wanted to see the propellers.

558
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,550
Like I said, women and machinery do not mix.

559
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
Was that the way of it?

560
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,890
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

561
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,720
Well, the boy's a hero then.

562
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,640
Good for you, son. Well done.

563
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,890
So, it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?

564
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,900
Look at you. You must be freezing. Let's get you inside.

565
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,900
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

566
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,400
Of course.

567
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,240
Mr. Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it.

568
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,580
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?

569
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,080
Rose is displeased.

570
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,250
What to do?

571
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,710
I know.

572
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,590
Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow evening...

573
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,430
to regale our group...

574
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,930
with your heroic tale.

575
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,430
Sure. Count me in.

576
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,100
Good. It's settled then.

577
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,440
This should be interesting.

578
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,450
Can I bum a smoke?

579
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,460
You'll want to tie those.

580
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,210
It's interesting...

581
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,550
the young lady slipped so suddenly...

582
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,140
and you still had time to remove your jacket and your shoes.

583
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
I know you've been melancholy.

584
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
I don't pretend to know why.

585
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,160
I intended to save this...

586
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,330
until the engagement gala next week...

587
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,010
but, I thought...

588
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,670
tonight.

589
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,340
Good gracious.

590
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,010
Perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you.

591
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,140
- Is it a...  - Diamond. Yes.

592
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,850
56 carats to be exact.

593
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,190
It was worn by Louis XVI.

594
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,360
And they called it Le Coeur de la Mer.

595
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,700
- The Heart of the Ocean.  - The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

596
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,870
It's overwhelming.

597
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,000
Well, it's for royalty.

598
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,380
We are royalty, Rose.

599
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,720
You know, there's nothing I couldn't give you.

600
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,550
There's nothing I'd deny you...

601
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,390
if you would not deny me.

602
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,900
Open your heart to me, Rose.

603
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,290
Well, I've been on my own since I was 15, since my folks died.

604
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,420
And I had no brothers or sisters or close kin in that part of the country...

605
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,220
so I lit on out of there and I haven't been back since.

606
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,590
You could just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

607
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,270
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile around this boat deck and...

608
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,560
chewed over how great the weather's been and how I grew up...

609
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,440
but I reckon that's not why you came to talk to me, is it?

610
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,440
- Mr. Dawson, I...  - Jack.

611
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Jack.

612
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,530
I want to thank you for what you did.

613
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:51,290
Not just for pulling me back, but for your discretion.

614
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,960
You're welcome.

615
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,460
Look.

616
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,210
I know what you must be thinking.

617
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,090
Poor little rich girl.

618
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,380
What does she know about misery?

619
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,630
No.

620
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,800
No, that's not what I was thinking.

621
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,390
What I was thinking was...

622
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,980
what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out?

623
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:15,650
Well I...

624
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,440
It was everything. It was my whole world and...

625
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,740
all the people in it.

626
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,570
And the inertia of my life, plunging ahead and me...

627
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,620
powerless to stop it.

628
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,830
God, look at that thing.

629
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,290
You would have gone straight to the bottom.

630
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,500
500 invitations have gone out.

631
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,500
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

632
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,800
And all the while I feel I'm...

633
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,090
standing in the middle of a crowded room...

634
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,840
screaming at the top of my lungs...

635
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,180
and no one even looks up.

636
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,010
Do you love him?

637
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,350
Pardon me?

638
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,140
Do you love him?

639
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,690
You're being very rude. You shouldn't be asking me this.

640
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,690
Well, it's a simple question. Do you love the guy or not?

641
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,200
This is not a suitable conversation.

642
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,700
Why can't you just answer the question?

643
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,330
This is absurd.

644
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,040
You don't know me and I don't know you...

645
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,330
and we are not having this conversation at all. You are rude...

646
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,880
and uncouth and presumptuous and I am leaving now...

647
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,050
Jack. Mr.Dawson. It's been a pleasure.

648
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,970
I sought you out to thank you and now I have thanked you.

649
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,180
And you've insulted me.

650
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,010
Well, you deserved it.

651
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,390
- Right.  - Right.

652
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,020
I thought you were leaving.

653
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,560
I am.

654
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,060
You are so annoying.

655
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,570
Wait.

656
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,070
I don't have to leave. This is my part of the ship. You leave.

657
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,410
Well, well, well. Now who's being rude?

658
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,080
What is this stupid thing you're carrying around?

659
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,580
So, what are you, an artist or something?

660
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,590
These are rather good.

661
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,100
They're very good, actually.

662
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,110
Jack, this is exquisite work.

663
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,110
Ah, they didn't think too much of them in old Paree.

664
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,610
Paris?

665
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,570
You do get around for a P...

666
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,080
Well, a... a person of limited means.

667
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,290
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

668
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,290
Well, well, well.

669
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,260
And these were drawn from life?

670
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,810
Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.

671
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,720
Lots of girls are willing to take their clothes off.

672
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,650
You liked this woman.

673
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,650
You used her several times.

674
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,820
Well.

675
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,490
She had beautiful hands, you see?

676
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,330
I think you must have had a love affair with her.

677
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,830
No, no, no. Just with her hands.

678
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,830
She was a one-legged prostitute.

679
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,960
See?

680
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,510
She had a good sense of humor though.

681
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,010
Oh, and this lady...

682
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,850
She used to sit at this bar every night...

683
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,690
wearing every piece of jewelry she owned...

684
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,270
just waiting for her long, lost love.

685
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,360
We called her Madame Bijoux.

686
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,700
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

687
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,200
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

688
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,870
You do.

689
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,700
You see people.

690
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,540
I see you.

691
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,290
And?

692
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,380
You wouldn't have jumped.

693
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,350
But the purpose of university is to find a suitable husband.

694
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,220
Rose has already done that.

695
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,390
Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

696
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,400
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

697
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,020
Hello, girls. I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

698
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,730
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

699
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,320
The Countess and I were just off to take the air on the boat deck.

700
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,570
What a lovely idea. I need to catch up on my gossip.

701
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,250
Countess.

702
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,580
So, you've not yet lit the last four boilers?

703
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,540
No, I don't see the need.

704
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,420
We are making excellent time.

705
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,260
The press knows the size of Titanic. Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

706
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,760
We must give them something new to print.

707
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,770
This maiden voyage of Titanic must...

708
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,850
make headlines.

709
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,110
Mr.Ismay, I would prefer not to push the engines...

710
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,940
until they've been properly run in.

711
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,570
Of course I'm just a passenger.

712
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,030
I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best.

713
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,280
But what a glorious end to your final crossing...

714
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,040
if we were to get into New York on Tuesday night...

715
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,790
and surprise them all. Make the morning papers.

716
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,580
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J?

717
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,630
Good man.

718
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,550
After that, I worked on a squid boat in Monterey...

719
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,470
then I went to Los Angeles to the...

720
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,890
Santa Monica pier and did portraits for 10 cents each.

721
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,480
Why can't I be like you?

722
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,310
Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.

723
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,070
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

724
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,490
only if we just talk about it.

725
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,660
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

726
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,660
Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up.

727
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:05,160
We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.

728
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,500
But you have to do it like a real cowboy. No sidesaddle stuff.

729
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,670
You mean with one leg on each side?

730
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,010
Can you show me?

731
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,090
Sure, if you like.

732
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,340
Teach me to ride like a man.

733
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,930
Chew tobacco like a man.

734
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,680
And spit like a man.

735
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,770
You didn't learn in finishing school?

736
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,190
No.

737
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,360
Come on, I'll show you.

738
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,360
I'll show you how.

739
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,530
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

740
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,860
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

741
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,870
Watch closely.

742
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,370
That's disgusting.

743
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,540
Your turn.

744
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,880
That was pitiful. You really have to hawk it back.

745
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,210
Get some leverage. Use your arms. Arc your neck.

746
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,550
You see the range on that thing?

747
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,550
Okay, go.

748
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:09,060
That was better. You have to work on it. Really try to hawk it up.

749
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,320
Mother.

750
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,080
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

751
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,080
Charmed, I'm sure.

752
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:38,420
The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life.

753
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,590
But my mother looked at him like an insect.

754
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,100
A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly.

755
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,270
Sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot.

756
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:58,940
Why do they always insist on announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

757
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,940
Shall we go dress, Mother?

758
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,780
See you at dinner, Jack.

759
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,780
Uh, son?

760
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,450
Son!

761
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,290
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

762
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:13,290
Not really.

763
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,130
You're about to go into the snake pit.

764
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,210
What are you going to wear?

765
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,300
I figured. Come on.

766
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:32,310
I was right. You and my son are just about the same size.

767
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,310
Pretty close.

768
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,320
You shine up like a new penny.

769
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,830
Good evening, sir.

770
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,900
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel are in this ship.

771
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,230
- Which part?  - All the right ones.

772
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,650
Then you're accountable if there's a problem. Where's Rose?

773
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,240
She'll be along.

774
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,570
There is the Countess.

775
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,940
I saw that in a nickelodeon and always wanted to do it.

776
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,540
Darling...

777
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,290
surely you remember Mr.Dawson.

778
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,710
It's amazing. You could almost pass for a gentleman.

779
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,130
Almost.

780
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,890
This is extraordinary.

781
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,150
This is a remarkable voyage.

782
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,820
- Mad.  - Completely lunatic.

783
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,570
There's the Countess of Rothes.

784
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,660
That's John Jacob Astor...

785
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:41,000
the richest man on board.

786
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:45,170
His little wifey, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition.

787
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,010
See how she tries to hide it.

788
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,670
Quite the scandal.

789
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,680
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs.Guggenheim...

790
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:58,600
is at home with the children, of course. And over here...

791
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,520
Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

792
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,100
She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents.

793
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,690
Very popular with the royals.

794
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,530
Congratulations. She's splendid.

795
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,360
Why, thank you.

796
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,610
Escort a lady to dinner?

797
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,370
Certainly.

798
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

799
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,950
Ain't nothing to it.

800
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,210
They love money. Pretend like you own a gold mine and you're in the club.

801
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,050
Hey, Astor.

802
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,550
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

803
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,720
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

804
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,470
Well, Jack...

805
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,560
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

806
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,150
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

807
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,730
Oh, yes.

808
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:52,740
He must have been nervous. But he never faltered.

809
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,740
They assumed he was one of them.

810
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:59,240
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

811
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,750
New money, obviously, but still a member of the club.

812
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,830
Mother. Of course. Could always be counted upon.

813
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:13,340
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr.Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

814
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,010
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

815
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,930
Mr.Dawson is joining us from third class.

816
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,520
He was of help to my fiancee last night.

817
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,610
It happens Mr.Dawson is quite a fine artist.

818
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,440
He showed me some of his work today.

819
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,780
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art. Not to impugn your work, sir.

820
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,630
Are all these mine?

821
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,960
Start from the outside and work in.

822
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,210
He knows every rivet in her.

823
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,800
Your ship is a wonder, Mr.Andrews.

824
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,390
Thank you, Rose.

825
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,140
How do you take your caviar, sir?

826
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,640
No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much.

827
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,150
Where exactly do you live, Mr.Dawson?

828
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,570
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

829
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,820
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

830
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,240
How do you have means to travel?

831
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,330
I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such.

832
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,330
I won my ticket on Titanic at a lucky hand at poker.

833
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,080
A very lucky hand.

834
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
All life is a game of luck.

835
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,090
A real man makes his own luck. Right, Dawson?

836
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,600
And you find that sort of rootless existence appealing?

837
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,270
Yes, ma'am, I do.

838
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:51,020
I've got everything I need right here with me.

839
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:54,110
I have air in my lungs and blank sheets of paper.

840
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:59,950
I love waking up, not knowing what will happen or who I'll meet.

841
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,280
Where I'll wind up.

842
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,950
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

843
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,460
now I'm on the grandest ship in the world having champagne with you fine people.

844
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:10,710
I'll take more of that.

845
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,050
Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.

846
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,880
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

847
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,890
You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.

848
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,140
Make each day count.

849
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:27,970
Well said, Jack.

850
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,310
Hear, hear.

851
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:35,230
To making it count.

852
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:36,730
Bravo.

853
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:47,410
But Mr.Brown didn't know I'd hidden the money in the stove.

854
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,750
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating and lights a fire.

855
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,420
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

856
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,680
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

857
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:09,020
Now they retreat to congratulate each other on being masters of the universe.

858
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,270
Ladies, thank you for your company.

859
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,020
May I escort you to the cabin?

860
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,270
No, I'll stay here.

861
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,110
Here, Molly.

862
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,110
Joining us, Dawson?

863
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,780
You don't want to stay with the women.

864
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,620
No, thanks. I have to head back.

865
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:30,620
That's best. It'll be all business and politics. Wouldn't interest you.

866
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,370
But Dawson, good of you to come.

867
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,300
Must you go?

868
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:42,880
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

869
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,990
Good night, Rose.

870
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,000


871
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,350
Want to go to a real party?

872
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,940
Is okay I put my hand here?

873
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,550
I can't understand you.

874
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:40,170
I'm going to dance with her now.

875
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,330
Come on.

876
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
Come on. Come with me.

877
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,090
Jack. Jack, wait.

878
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,430
I can't do this.

879
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,510
We'll have to get a bit closer.

880
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,930
Like this.

881
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,930
You're still my best girl, Cora.

882
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:04,360
- I don't know the steps.  - Me, either. Just go with it.

883
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,190
Don't think.

884
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,960
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

885
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,310
What? Wait!

886
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,190
Jack, no.

887
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:31,690
Beyond the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act.

888
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:35,780
That's what Rockefeller said... Supreme Court didn't swallow it.

889
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:59,720
What? You think a first-class girl can't drink?

890
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:02,980
Get out of here.

891
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,890
Are you all right?

892
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,900
I'm fine.

893
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:10,150
Two out of three.

894
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,400
So...

895
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,570
you think you're tough?

896
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,410
Let's see you do this.

897
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,410
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

898
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,180
Jesus!

899
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:43,600
You okay?

900
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,440
I haven't done that in years.

901
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:56,280
Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.

902
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,640
Coffee, sir?

903
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:35,240
You didn't come to me last night.

904
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:38,990
I was tired.

905
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,160
Your exertions below deck were no doubt exhausting.

906
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,830
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

907
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:54,090
You will never behave like that again.

908
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,680
I'm not one of your mill foremen who you can command.

909
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,850
I'm your fiancee.

910
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,520
My fiancee. My fiancee!

911
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,850
Yes, you are! And my wife!

912
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:15,690
My wife in practice, if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

913
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:18,780
You will honor me the way a wife honors her husband.

914
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,280
Because I will not be made a fool of.

915
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,950
Is this in any way unclear?

916
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,040
No.

917
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,710
Good. Excuse me.

918
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,050
Oh, Miss Rose.

919
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,300
We had a little accident.

920
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,720
- That's all right.  - I'm sorry.

921
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,140
Let me help you.

922
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:46,980
It's all right, miss.

923
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:02,500
- Tea, Trudy.  - Yes, Ma'am.

924
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:20,590
You're not to see that boy again. You understand?

925
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:24,260
Rose, I forbid it.

926
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,260
Stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

927
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,270
This is not a game.

928
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,440
Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone.

929
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:39,110
Of course I know. You remind me every day.

930
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:45,030
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name.

931
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,950
That name is the only card we have to play.

932
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,290
I don't understand you.

933
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,960
It is a fine match with Hockley. It will ensure our survival.

934
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,960
How can you put this on me?

935
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,710
Why are you being so selfish?

936
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,050
I'm being selfish?

937
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:08,470
Do you want to see me working as a seamstress?

938
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,140
Is that what you want?

939
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:17,650
To see our fine things sold at auction?

940
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,150
Our memories scattered?

941
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,000
It's so unfair.

942
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:37,170
Of course it's unfair.

943
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,840
We're women.

944
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,510
Our choices are never easy.

945
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,200
Protect them by Thy guiding hand

946
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:15,370
From every peril on the land

947
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,380
O, spirit whom the Father sent

948
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:26,220
To spread abroad the firmament

949
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:30,890
O, wind of heaven, by Thy might

950
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:36,060
Save all who dare the eagle's flight

951
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:40,230
And keep them by Thy watchful care...

952
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,570
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.  - Hello, Jack.

953
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,250
I need to talk to someone.

954
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,750
You're not supposed to be in here.

955
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,000
I was here last night, remember?

956
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,920
No. Now please turn around.

957
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,010
He'll tell you. I just need to talk...

958
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,430
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

959
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,600
are still appreciative of your assistance.

960
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,440
They asked me to give you this in gratitude...

961
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,270
I don't want your money.

962
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:26,440
And remind you you are in third class and your presence here...

963
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,440
is no longer appropriate.

964
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,030
Let me speak to Rose.

965
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,280
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson returns to where he belongs...

966
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,290
and that he stays there?

967
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,120
Yes, sir.

968
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:39,540
Come along, you.

969
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:44,790
Hear us when we cry to Thee

970
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:49,630
For those in peril on the sea

971
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,470
Why are there two steering wheels?

972
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,220
We use this one near shore.

973
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:58,140
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning, from the Noordam.

974
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,730
Thank you, Sparks.

975
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:05,310
Not to worry. Quite normal for this time of year.

976
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,320
In fact, we're speeding up. I've ordered the last boilers lit.

977
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:17,330
Okay, son, wind it up tight like I showed you. That's right.

978
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,160
Okay, now let it go.

979
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,210
- It was good, wasn't it?  - Quite nice. That's excellent.

980
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:34,220
Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.

981
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,260
I did the sum in my head...

982
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:40,390
and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned...

983
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:44,230
Forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.

984
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:46,730
About half, actually.

985
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,070
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

986
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,070
In fact, I put in these new type davits...

987
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,030
which can take an extra row of boats inside this one.

988
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,700
But it was thought, by some...

989
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:59,450
the deck would look too cluttered.

990
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,250
So, I was overruled.

991
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,750
It's a waste of deck space as it is on an unsinkable ship.

992
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,750
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

993
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,460
I have built you a good ship, strong and true.

994
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,420
She's all the lifeboat you need.

995
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,760
Just keep heading aft. The next stop will be the engine room.

996
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:25,440
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.

997
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,610
- I need to talk to you.  - No, Jack. No.

998
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,440
Jack. I'm engaged.

999
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:35,280
I'm marrying Cal.

1000
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,240
I love Cal.

1001
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,120
Rose...

1002
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:46,120
you're no picnic. All right? You're a spoiled little brat even.

1003
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:50,960
But under that, you're the most amazingly, astounding...

1004
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,960
wonderful girl...

1005
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,420
woman, that I've ever known.

1006
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,590
Jack, I...

1007
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,350
No, let me try and get this out. You're ama...

1008
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,810
I'm not an idiot. I know how the world works.

1009
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,020
I've got ten bucks in my pocket.

1010
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,940
I have nothing to offer you and I know that.

1011
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:11,820
I understand.

1012
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,440
But I'm too involved now.

1013
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,820
You jump, I jump. Remember?

1014
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,660
I can't turn away without knowing you'll be all right.

1015
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,450
That's all that I want.

1016
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,330
Well, I'm fine.

1017
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,000
I'll be fine. Really.

1018
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,170
Really?

1019
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,840
I don't think so.

1020
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,970
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1021
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,510
And you're gonna die if you don't break free.

1022
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,680
Maybe not right away...

1023
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,470
because you're strong...

1024
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:47,180
but sooner or later that fire that I love about you, Rose...

1025
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,020
that fire is gonna burn out.

1026
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,650
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1027
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,360
You're right.

1028
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,370
Only you can do that.

1029
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,880
I'm going back.

1030
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,710
Leave me alone.

1031
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,390
Tell Lucile about the disaster you had with the stationers.

1032
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,350
Well, of course the invitations had to be sent back, twice.

1033
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,730
Oh, my dear.

1034
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,560
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

1035
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,030
Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been.

1036
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,530
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1037
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,450
She knows I detest the color.

1038
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,200
So, she did it only to spite me.

1039
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,410
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1040
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,540
Ruth saw some of my designs in La Mode Illustree.

1041
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,080
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1042
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,210
They were quite charming.

1043
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,290
But, I think you'll agree, my dear, that together...

1044
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:57,760
we've created something of a phoenix from the ashes.

1045
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,560
Hello, Jack.

1046
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,110
I changed my mind.

1047
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,290
They said you might be up here.

1048
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,620
Give me your hand.

1049
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:41,470
Now close your eyes.

1050
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,130
Go on.

1051
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,970
Now, step up.

1052
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,100
Now, hold onto the railing.

1053
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:56,190
Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.

1054
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,440
I'm not.

1055
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,820
Now, step up onto the rail.

1056
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,820
Hold on. Hold on.

1057
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,160
Keep your eyes closed.

1058
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,000
Do you trust me?

1059
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,830
I trust you.

1060
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,670
All right...

1061
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,550
open your eyes.

1062
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,640
I'm flying.

1063
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,140
Jack.

1064
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:04,380
Come, Josephine, in my flying machine. Going up...

1065
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,550
she goes. Up she goes.

1066
01:22:56,270 --> 01:23:00,270
That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

1067
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:02,820
We're up to dusk the night of the sinking.

1068
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,900
6 hours to go.

1069
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:08,070
Incredible. There's Smith and he's standing there and...

1070
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,820
he's got the iceberg warning in his fucking hand...

1071
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:13,080
excuse me... his hand, and he's ordering more speed.

1072
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,450
26 years of experience working against him.

1073
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,750
He figures anything big enough to sink, the ship...

1074
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,670
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1075
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,420
But the ship's too big with too small a rudder.

1076
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,630
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1077
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,130
Everything he knows is wrong.

1078
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:45,650
It's quite proper, I assure you. This is the sitting room.

1079
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,150
- Will this light do?  - What?

1080
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:51,820
Don't artists need good light?

1081
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,320
That is true, but I'm not used to working in...

1082
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,700
such horrible conditions.

1083
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,830
Monet!

1084
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,330
- Do you know his work?  - Of course.

1085
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,670
Look at his use of color here. Isn't he great?

1086
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,960
I know. It's extraordinary.

1087
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,800
Cal insists on carting this hideous thing everywhere.

1088
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:16,140
Should we be expecting him any time soon?

1089
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,980
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.

1090
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,350
That's nice.

1091
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,400
What is it, a sapphire?

1092
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,320
A diamond.

1093
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:30,400
A very rare diamond.

1094
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,830
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.

1095
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,540
Wearing this.

1096
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:41,040
All right.

1097
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,880
Wearing only this.

1098
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:24,080
The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a porcelain doll.

1099
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,040
As a paying customer...

1100
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,920
I expect to get what I want.

1101
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,570
Over on the bed ... uh, the couch.

1102
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,750
Come. Lie down.

1103
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,750
- Tell me when it looks right.  - Keep that.

1104
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,800
Put your arm back the way it was.

1105
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:17,630
Put that other arm up, that hand right by your face there.

1106
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,140
Right.

1107
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,310
Now, head down.

1108
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,810
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1109
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,980
And try to stay still.

1110
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,500
So serious.

1111
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,880
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste.

1112
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:44,220
I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

1113
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,220
He does landscapes.

1114
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:50,060
- Just relax your face.  - Sorry.

1115
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,730
No laughing.

1116
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,760
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1117
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,100
It was the most erotic moment of my life...

1118
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:36,110
up until then, at least.

1119
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,400
So what happened next?

1120
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,950
You mean, did we do it?

1121
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:46,780
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1122
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,790
Jack was very professional.

1123
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:58,960
Thank you.

1124
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,430
What are you doing?

1125
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,600
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1126
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,490
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

1127
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,830
None of the stewards have seen her.

1128
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:33,620
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1129
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:35,870
There's only so many places she could be.

1130
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,830
Lovejoy, find her.

1131
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,480
- Clear.  - Yes.

1132
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:01,690
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm.

1133
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,190
Like a mill pond.

1134
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,900
Not a breath of wind.

1135
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:10,030
It will make the bergs harder to see...

1136
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,330
with no breaking water at the base.

1137
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,840
Well, I'm off.

1138
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,090
Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1139
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,100
Yes, sir.

1140
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,730
It's getting cold. You look nice.

1141
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:45,400
Miss Rose?

1142
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,570
My drawings!

1143
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,890
Come on!

1144
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,940
Wait, wait, wait!

1145
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,440
- Go. Go. Down, down.  - Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1146
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,070
Bye.

1147
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,290
Sorry.

1148
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:48,300
- Keep going.  - Thank you, I've got it.

1149
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,440
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1150
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,270
Seems more like a cop.

1151
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,610
I think he was.

1152
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,940
- Oh, shit.  - Go!

1153
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:12,320
No, over here!

1154
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,820
Quick!

1155
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:22,000
Now what?

1156
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:23,630
What?

1157
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,510
More coal for number one, mate.

1158
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,300
Hold up? What are you two doing down here?

1159
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,840
You shouldn't be down here.

1160
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,220
It could be dangerous!

1161
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:41,640
Carry on!

1162
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,900
Don't mind us. You're doing a great job!

1163
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,560
Keep up the good work!

1164
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:03,870
Look at what we have here, huh?

1165
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,390
Thank you.

1166
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,910
Where to, miss?

1167
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,740
To the stars.

1168
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,260
You nervous?

1169
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:03,890
No.

1170
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,790
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1171
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:48,310
It's bloody cold.

1172
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:52,320
You know, I can smell ice, you know. When it's near.

1173
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:54,980
Bollocks!

1174
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,990
Well, I can, all right?

1175
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,450
Did you ever find those binoculars for the lookouts?

1176
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,490
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1177
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,490
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

1178
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:05,450
Cheerio.

1179
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,030
You're trembling.

1180
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:41,530
Don't worry.

1181
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,410
I'll be all right.

1182
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,560
- They ran down there.  - Right.

1183
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,980
Anything missing?

1184
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,580


1185
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:44,840
I have a better idea.

1186
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:58,860
Got you!

1187
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,950
Did you see those guys' faces?

1188
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:13,370
Did you see them?

1189
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,550
When the ship docks...

1190
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,630
I'm getting off with you.

1191
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,050
This is crazy.

1192
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:30,060
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1193
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,060
That's why I trust it.

1194
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:44,740
Here, look at this.

1195
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:47,570
Look at that, would you?

1196
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:49,410
They're warmer than we are.

1197
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:54,160
If that's what it takes for us to get warm, I'd rather not.

1198
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:07,930
Bugger me!

1199
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:14,770
Pick up, you bastards!

1200
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,440
Is anyone there?!

1201
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:20,860
What do you see?

1202
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:22,530
Iceberg, right ahead!

1203
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:23,860
Thank you.

1204
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,200
Iceberg ahead!

1205
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,370
Hard a' starboard!

1206
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:38,540
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1207
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,800
Full astern!

1208
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,130
Hard over.

1209
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,970
Helm's hard over, sir.

1210
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,140
Go, lads, go!

1211
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:00,310
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1212
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:04,980
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1213
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:10,820
Hold it.

1214
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,660
Hold it!

1215
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,830
Now! Engage reversing engine!

1216
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,360
Why ain't they turning?

1217
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:48,780
Is it hard over?!

1218
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:51,030
It is, sir. Hard over.

1219
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,210
Come on, come on, come on. Turn.

1220
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,720
Yes.

1221
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:18,560
It's going to hit!

1222
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:31,490
Jesus Christ!

1223
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,430
Jesus!

1224
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,260
Hard to port!

1225
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:07,610
Get back!

1226
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,390
Let's go!

1227
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:41,970
Get in the doors! They're closing the doors! Get out!

1228
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,820
Get out the door! Go!

1229
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,150
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1230
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:05,500
Go! Go!

1231
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Out! Out!

1232
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,350
Oh, my God.

1233
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:26,520
That was a close shave.

1234
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,770
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

1235
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:36,700
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1236
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:44,120
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1237
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,460
An iceberg, sir.

1238
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:51,040
I put her hard to starboard, and the engines full astern, but it was too close.

1239
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,550
I tried to port round it, but she hit...

1240
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:57,050
- Close the watertight doors.  - They're closed, sir.

1241
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,390
All stop.

1242
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:12,900
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

1243
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:27,910
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1244
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:35,590
Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.

1245
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,510
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

1246
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,590
That's the shudder you felt. Do you need anything?

1247
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:43,510
No, thank you.

1248
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,940
There's talk of an iceberg.

1249
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:52,940
I don't see anything. Do you?

1250
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:58,280
If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.

1251
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:06,950
- You there.  - There is no emergency.

1252
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,040
- There is. I've been robbed.  - Get the Master at Arms.

1253
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,290
Now, you moron!

1254
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,300
Did I miss the fun?

1255
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:23,140
- Did you see what happened?  - No. I missed it. Apparently it hit over there.

1256
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:28,560
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet and the mail hold is worse. She's all buckled in in the forward hold.

1257
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:31,230
- Can you shore up?  - Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1258
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:34,650
- Have you seen the mail hold?  - It's already underwater.

1259
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,900
This is bad.

1260
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,820
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1261
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:43,990
I think they're very good, sir.

1262
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:49,830
Don't touch anything. I want the room photographed.

1263
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,000
We've been looking for you, miss.

1264
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:02,930
Here we go.

1265
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:10,270
Something serious has happened.

1266
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:13,350
Yes, it has.

1267
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:18,270
Indeed. Two things dear to me have disappeared.

1268
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:22,700
Now that one is back, I know where to find the other. Search him.

1269
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,780
- Take your coat off.  - Now what?

1270
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:29,950
What are you doing? We're in the middle of an emergency.

1271
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,290
- Is this it?  - That's it.

1272
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:34,710
This is horseshit!

1273
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:37,380
Don't you believe it.

1274
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:41,050
- He couldn't have.  - Easy enough for a professional.

1275
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,800
I was with him the entire time. This is absurd.

1276
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:47,050
Perhaps he did it while you were putting your clothes back on, dear.

1277
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,970
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

1278
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:54,060
- Shut up.  - It isn't even your pocket.

1279
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:55,810
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1280
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:01,650
That was reported stolen today.

1281
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,490
I just borrowed it.

1282
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:06,070
Oh, we have an honest thief.

1283
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:08,570
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1284
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:11,410
Don't believe them. You know it.

1285
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,660
Let's go, son.

1286
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:14,750
You know I didn't do it!

1287
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,080
There's a good lad. Come on.

1288
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,750
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1289
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:24,920
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1290
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:31,850
Water fourteen feet above the keel in ten minutes...

1291
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:35,430
in the forepeak, all three holds and boiler room six.

1292
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:36,690
That's right.

1293
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:38,270
When can we get underway?

1294
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,520
That's five compartments.

1295
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:46,450
She can float with four compartments breached, but not five.

1296
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:50,780
Not five. As she goes down by the head, the water will spill...

1297
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:55,200
over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck, one to the next...

1298
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:58,120
back and back. There's no stopping it.

1299
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:59,710
The pumps. If we opened the doors...

1300
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,130
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1301
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,050
As of now, no matter what we do...

1302
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:09,140
Titanic will founder.

1303
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:12,810
But this ship can't sink.

1304
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,890
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1305
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,480
And she will.

1306
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:20,400
It's a mathematical certainty.

1307
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:26,320
How much time?

1308
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:36,330
An hour. Two, at most.

1309
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,420
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1310
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,670
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1311
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:57,850
Well, I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1312
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:17,540
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1313
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:20,540
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1314
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:22,960
- Mr. Hockley?  - Not now. We're busy.

1315
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:26,630
You've been asked to put on lifebelts and go to the boat deck.

1316
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,880
I said, not now.

1317
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:33,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders. Dress warmly.

1318
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:35,550
It's quite cold out.

1319
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:38,720
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1320
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,890
This is ridiculous.

1321
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:45,230
Not to worry, miss. I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1322
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:47,570
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1323
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:50,820
What's he on about?

1324
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,570
- Put your lifebelts on!  - What is it?

1325
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,160
Just put them on.

1326
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:57,580
C.Q. D?

1327
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:59,410
Sir?

1328
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,920
That's right, C.Q.D. The distress call. That's our position.

1329
01:49:10,510 --> 01:49:14,760
Tell whoever responds we're going down by the head and need immediate assistance.

1330
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:25,600
Blimey.

1331
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:39,950
Keep lowering!

1332
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:47,630
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1333
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:55,470
Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!

1334
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,470
Release those ties!

1335
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,560
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1336
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,640
Where are the passengers?

1337
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:06,230
They went inside. Too cold and noisy for them.

1338
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:10,820
You there! Get down here and help with these lines!

1339
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,830
Care for a drink, sir?

1340
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:34,260
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up and now we're cooling our heels.

1341
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:37,010
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1342
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:40,010
Nobody knows what's going on.

1343
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,180
Just like the damn English... everything by the book.

1344
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:46,190
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1345
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:51,190
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms. I want a cup of tea when I return.

1346
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,040
Mr. Andrews.

1347
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,370
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.

1348
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:10,380
Please tell me the truth.

1349
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:20,390
The ship will sink.

1350
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,140
You're certain?

1351
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:29,060
In an hour or so, all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1352
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:36,070
Please, tell only who you must. I don't want to cause a panic.

1353
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,240
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1354
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:43,080
You remember what I told you about the boats?

1355
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:46,750
Yes.

1356
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,080
I understand.

1357
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:59,430
Over here, son.

1358
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:03,600
Sir, there's a big mob at the Second Class Purser's office.

1359
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:05,680
Go on. I'll watch him.

1360
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:08,430
Aye. Right.

1361
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:27,120
Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots. Full steam for them, sir.

1362
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,370
She's the only one responding?

1363
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:34,210
The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.

1364
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,630
Four hours?!

1365
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:43,140
Thank you, Bride.

1366
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:49,140
My God.

1367
01:52:58,650 --> 01:53:00,650
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1368
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:06,070
Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats?

1369
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:08,990
Yes.

1370
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:16,340
Women and children first, yes.

1371
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,170
Yes, sir.

1372
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:24,680
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

1373
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,680
Step this way, please. That's right.

1374
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:30,850
Come towards me. Thank you.

1375
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:32,850
Good.

1376
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:37,360
For the time being, I require only women and children.

1377
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,020
Right here.

1378
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:43,700
Like the Captain said, nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1379
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,030
"Wedding Dance."

1380
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:57,040
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1381
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:00,050
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1382
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:03,380
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn that around.

1383
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,060
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1384
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:13,060
Please, stay calm.

1385
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:16,560
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1386
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:19,310
Let women and children through to the front.

1387
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:20,900
What are we doing, mummy?

1388
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:24,240
Waiting. Once first-class people are in the boats...

1389
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:27,820
they'll start with us and we want to be ready.

1390
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:31,240
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1391
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:32,910
Go get help.

1392
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:37,250
Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.

1393
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,920
Both sides together! Steady!

1394
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:44,090
Steady!

1395
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:47,590
Stop, stop, stop!

1396
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:49,600
Hold the left!

1397
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:52,430
Right side only! Right side only!

1398
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:53,930
Right side!

1399
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:58,100
Hold the left! Right side down! Lower away together!

1400
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,940
Steady, lads!

1401
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:52,820
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1402
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:59,500
I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation.

1403
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,670
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1404
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:14,100
Come on, sister, you heard the man. Into the boat.

1405
01:56:14,430 --> 01:56:16,560
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1406
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:18,100
Only women at this time, sir.

1407
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,810
Will the lifeboats be seated according to class?

1408
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:28,440
I hope they're not too crowded.

1409
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,070
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1410
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:33,120
Don't you understand?

1411
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,330
The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats.

1412
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:37,240
Not enough by half.

1413
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:40,620
Half the people on this ship are going to die.

1414
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,580
Not the better half.

1415
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,500
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1416
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:47,960
First class seats are right up here.

1417
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:50,970
You know, it's a pity I didn't keep that drawing.

1418
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:52,680
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1419
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,310
You unimaginable bastard.

1420
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,100
Come on, Rose darling. There's plenty of room for you.

1421
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,020
Come on, Rose.

1422
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,150
You're next, darling.

1423
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,650
Come into the boat, Rose.

1424
01:57:11,110 --> 01:57:12,110
Come.

1425
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,490
Rose.

1426
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,620
Get into the boat!

1427
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:18,120
Rose.

1428
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,450
Good-bye, Mother.

1429
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:26,130
Where are you going?

1430
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,840
To him?!

1431
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,300
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1432
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:33,840
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1433
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,350
No!

1434
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:41,060
I said, no!

1435
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:44,690
Rose! Please, stop!

1436
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,310
And, lower away!

1437
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,650
No, Wait!

1438
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:50,730
Lower away!

1439
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,690
- Rose!  - Lower together!

1440
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,740
Hold the left side!

1441
01:57:58,660 --> 01:57:59,660
Help!

1442
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:02,660
Can anybody hear me?!

1443
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:05,710
Hello! Help me!

1444
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:07,540
Help me!

1445
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:10,380
Can you hear me?!

1446
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:14,720
Can anybody hear me?! Somebody help me!

1447
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:17,390
Mr. Andrews?!

1448
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,230
Steward, check the starboard corridor.

1449
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,020
Madame, please put on a lifebelt. Get to the boat deck immediately.

1450
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,190
Lucy, for God's sake put on your lifebelt and set a good example.

1451
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,270
Yes sir.

1452
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,230
- Anyone in here?  - Mr. Andrews!

1453
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:34,400
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1454
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:37,030
Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?

1455
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:38,910
What? You have to get to a boat right away.

1456
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:40,030
No!

1457
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,370
I'm doing this with or without your help, sir.

1458
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:43,910
But without will take longer.

1459
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,040
Take the elevator to the very bottom. Go to the left...

1460
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:50,380
down the crewmen's passage.

1461
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:53,130
Then go right and left again at the stairs.

1462
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:54,550
You'll come to a long corridor.

1463
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:01,100
This could be bad.

1464
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,600
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1465
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,940
Excuse me. Thank you.

1466
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:21,450
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1467
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:25,120
I'm through being polite, goddamnit!

1468
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,330
Now take me down!

1469
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:28,960
E deck.

1470
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:33,630
Come on.

1471
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,420
Come on, come on.

1472
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,610
I'm going back up.

1473
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:56,820
No! No! No!

1474
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:02,820
Come back! I'm going back up!

1475
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:04,160
I'm going back up!

1476
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,170
Crew passage.

1477
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:38,530
Jack!

1478
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:52,330
Rose!

1479
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:56,170
Rose, I'm in here!

1480
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:59,710
I'm in here!

1481
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:03,930
Jack! I'm sorry.

1482
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,600
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1483
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:08,970
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

1484
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,930
I know, I know...

1485
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:12,060
Listen Rose...

1486
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:14,650
you're gonna have to find the spare key, all right?

1487
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:16,020
Look in that cabinet right there.

1488
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:19,480
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1489
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:23,570
These are all brass ones!

1490
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:25,950
Check right here, Rose.

1491
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:31,540
Rose.

1492
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:34,460
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1493
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,920
I didn't.

1494
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:38,040
I just realized I already knew.

1495
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:41,630
Keep looking.

1496
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:52,020
No key.

1497
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,560
There's no key!

1498
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,640
All right, Rose, listen.

1499
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:56,350
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1500
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:58,230
It'll be all right.

1501
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:05,070
I'll be right back.

1502
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:14,500
I'll just wait here!

1503
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,010
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1504
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,220
Hello?

1505
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,480
Is there anybody down here?

1506
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:36,480
We need help! Hello?

1507
02:02:38,190 --> 02:02:39,190
Damnit!

1508
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:49,530
Can anybody hear me, please?! Hello...

1509
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:52,870
Oh, thank God.

1510
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,330
Wait, please, I need your help.

1511
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:55,620
There's a man back here and he's...

1512
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,500
Wait!

1513
02:03:01,710 --> 02:03:03,050
Hello?!

1514
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:29,860
Hello?

1515
02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:32,830
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1516
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,330
I need your help.

1517
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:36,450
There is a man down here and he is trapped.

1518
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,660
- This way, yes. All right.  - Please!

1519
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,830
- There's no need to panic.  - No, I'm not panicking!

1520
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,920
You're going the wrong way!

1521
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:44,000
Let go of me! Listen!!!

1522
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:50,680
To hell with you.

1523
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:30,130
Oh, my God.

1524
02:05:22,190 --> 02:05:23,770
Will this work?

1525
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,770
I guess we'll find out.

1526
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:27,440
Come on.

1527
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:31,530
Wait, wait, wait.

1528
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,700
Try a couple practice swings over there.

1529
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:40,910
Good.

1530
02:05:41,210 --> 02:05:43,000
Now try and hit the same mark again, Rose. You can do it.

1531
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:52,170
Okay, that's enough practice. Come on, Rose.

1532
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:53,930
You can do it.

1533
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:57,890
Listen, just hit it really hard and really fast.

1534
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:00,560
Come on. Wait.

1535
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:02,890
Open your hands up a little more.

1536
02:06:03,230 --> 02:06:04,560
- Like that?  - Right.

1537
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:07,610
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1538
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:13,570
Go.

1539
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:20,950
You did it!

1540
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:22,910
Come on. Let's go.

1541
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,580
Oh shit, this is cold! Oh, shit!

1542
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:27,500
Shit! Shit!

1543
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:34,170
This is the way out.

1544
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:37,760
We have to find another way. Come on.

1545
02:06:40,810 --> 02:06:41,810
Pull.

1546
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:43,850
Put your backs into it.

1547
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:50,820
Pull!

1548
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:54,610
Now, there's something you don't see every day.

1549
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:19,300
What's this luggage doing here? Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1550
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:20,510
We need the room. Get rid of that. Out.

1551
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:25,390
This way. Let go, sir. Get back.

1552
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:26,980
Keep calm!

1553
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,320
Lovejoy!

1554
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,700
She's not on the starboard side either.

1555
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:41,990
We're running out of time. This strutting martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1556
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:44,660
There's one on the other side letting men on.

1557
02:07:45,330 --> 02:07:46,620
Well then, that's our play.

1558
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:49,460
We'll need some insurance first. Come on.

1559
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:52,420
This way, please. All the way down here.

1560
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:56,510
Here!

1561
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,010
What do you think you're doing?

1562
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:01,510
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1563
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,510
That's White Star Line property.

1564
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:05,350
Shut up!

1565
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:09,350
Will you hold the boat a moment? I just have to run back to my room...

1566
02:08:10,190 --> 02:08:11,230
Sit down!

1567
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:12,900
She's the last.

1568
02:08:13,070 --> 02:08:14,820
- Prepare to lower.  - Mr. Lightoller.

1569
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:16,900
Why are the boats being launched half full?

1570
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:18,190
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1571
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:21,610
There, look. 20 or so in a boat built for 65?

1572
02:08:21,870 --> 02:08:23,870
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!

1573
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:27,250
Well, we weren't sure of the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1574
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:28,580
These boats may buckle.

1575
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:29,790
Rubbish!

1576
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:32,710
They were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men.

1577
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:35,590
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man!

1578
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:45,720
Please, I need more women and children, please!

1579
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,230
Get back in there!

1580
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,060
This is not an exit. This is not an exit.

1581
02:08:57,650 --> 02:09:00,320
You can't keep us locked in here. Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1582
02:09:01,570 --> 02:09:03,570
Bring forward the women!

1583
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:05,410
Unlock the gates.

1584
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:08,240
Women only!

1585
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:12,420
No men!

1586
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:21,170
Get back!

1587
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:22,630
Lock the gates!

1588
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:24,800
Get them back from those gates!

1589
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,470
Don't touch the gates!

1590
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:32,480
For God's sake, man...

1591
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:34,150
there are women and children down here!

1592
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,770
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1593
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:38,820
Get back!

1594
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:43,700
Tommy!

1595
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,280
- Can we get out?  - It's hopeless that way.

1596
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:47,030
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.

1597
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:52,210
The boats are all going.

1598
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:54,290
This whole place is flooding. We've gotta get out of here.

1599
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:55,500
There is niente this way.

1600
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:57,880
Let's go this way, all right? Come on!

1601
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:05,130
I make my own luck.

1602
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:06,970
So do I.

1603
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:16,150
Come on!

1604
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:17,690
No, come on, let's go this way.

1605
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,410
This way!

1606
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,660
Just go back to the main stairwell.

1607
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:33,120
And everything will be sorted out there.

1608
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:36,420
It will all get sorted out back there.

1609
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:37,920
Go back to the main stairwell.

1610
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,000
- Open the gate!  - Go back down the main stairwell.

1611
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:41,590
Open the gate right now!

1612
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,920
Go back down the main stairwell, like I told you.

1613
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:48,680
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1614
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:50,680
Stop that!

1615
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:55,640
Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand here.

1616
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:56,730
Move aside.

1617
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:58,980
Come on, pull!

1618
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:00,860
Pull!

1619
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:03,150
Move aside. Quickly, move aside!

1620
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,280
Put that down!

1621
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,610
- Move aside!  - Put that down!

1622
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:07,030
One! Two!

1623
02:11:07,950 --> 02:11:09,120
Three!

1624
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:12,540
Again!

1625
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,580
Now, let's go!

1626
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,960
Let's go, Rose.

1627
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,210
You can't go up there! You can't do this!

1628
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:29,390
Keep order! Keep order here!

1629
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,560
Back! Back! Back!

1630
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:38,140
Hold on to her!

1631
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:40,770
Pull her in!

1632
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:44,230
Get back, I say, or I'll...

1633
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:46,740
shoot you all like dogs!

1634
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:48,570
Keep order here!

1635
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:51,740
Keep order, I say.

1636
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,740
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1637
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:03,420
Right. Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1638
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:11,260
Stay back.

1639
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:12,930
We're too late.

1640
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:16,270
There are more boats down the front. Stay with this one. Murdoch.

1641
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,060
He seems to be quite practical.

1642
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:24,270
Don't lower it!

1643
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:26,780
Cut the falls!

1644
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,120
Sit down!

1645
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,870
Stay back, you lot!

1646
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:40,290
Just stay back, the lot of you! Stay back!

1647
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,630
It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.

1648
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:48,630
Mr. Murdoch?

1649
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:51,470
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1650
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:53,300
I'm a businessman, as you know...

1651
02:12:53,470 --> 02:12:55,050
and I have a business proposition for you.

1652
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:03,980
Come on, Rose.

1653
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,480
The boats are gone!

1654
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,830
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

1655
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:18,450
No, miss, but there are a couple of boats all the way forward.

1656
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:20,200
This way, I'll lead you.

1657
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:29,760
What's the use? Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1658
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:31,550
Well, they don't listen to us at dinner, either.

1659
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:32,760
Come on, let's play.

1660
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,220
Keep us warm.

1661
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:36,350
"Orpheus."

1662
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:43,980
Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in first class.

1663
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:53,200
- Where is everyone?  - They're all still aft, sir.

1664
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:57,370
We have an understanding then, Mr. Murdoch.

1665
02:14:08,710 --> 02:14:12,720
Will the men please hold back! Hold back, I say!

1666
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:17,850
Women and children only!

1667
02:14:18,010 --> 02:14:19,930
Get back!

1668
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:22,890
Come through, madame. This way. Step back, sir!

1669
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:27,230
You better check the other side. Go!

1670
02:14:34,570 --> 02:14:36,410
I found her, on the other side.

1671
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:38,490
Waiting for a boat.

1672
02:14:38,990 --> 02:14:39,990
With him.

1673
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:43,750
- Any more women and children?  - They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1674
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:45,920
Anyone else then?

1675
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:48,920
- Anyone else?  - Do hurry. Hurry along.

1676
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:57,090
Goddamn it all to hell.

1677
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:01,100
Shit.

1678
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:02,390
Fire!

1679
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:05,730
Sir, sir, you can't go through here.

1680
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,690
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1681
02:15:15,610 --> 02:15:17,280
Prepare to lower.

1682
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:21,280
Ready on the left.

1683
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:28,870
Take them down.

1684
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:35,050
Keep it steady.

1685
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:41,640
Both sides together. Steady. Keep it steady.

1686
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:44,010
- Give her to me.  - Daddy.

1687
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:47,180
It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.

1688
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,190
Daddy, get in the boat.

1689
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:52,360
It's good-bye for a little while. Only for a little while.

1690
02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:54,650
There'll be another boat for the daddies.

1691
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:56,400
This boat is for the mummies and the children.

1692
02:15:56,530 --> 02:15:58,610
You hold Mummy's hand and be a good little girl.

1693
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,450
I'm not going without you.

1694
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:03,240
No, you have to go, now.

1695
02:16:03,370 --> 02:16:04,370
No, Jack.

1696
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:05,790
Get in the boat, Rose.

1697
02:16:05,870 --> 02:16:07,040
No, Jack.

1698
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:08,120
Yes.

1699
02:16:08,210 --> 02:16:09,210
Get on the boat!

1700
02:16:09,290 --> 02:16:11,630
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1701
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:15,630
Oh my God, look at you.

1702
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,720
You look a fright.

1703
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,800
Here.

1704
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:22,720
Put this on. Come.

1705
02:16:27,730 --> 02:16:29,560
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1706
02:16:29,810 --> 02:16:31,650
No, not without you.

1707
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,730
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

1708
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:35,900
I'm a survivor, all right? Don't worry about me.

1709
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,530
Now, go on. Get on.

1710
02:16:38,070 --> 02:16:39,700
I have an arrangement with an officer on the other side of the ship.

1711
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:41,700
Jack and I can get off safely.

1712
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,240
Both of us.

1713
02:16:44,410 --> 02:16:45,490
See?

1714
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:46,620
I got my own boat to catch.

1715
02:16:47,410 --> 02:16:48,410
Go on, hurry.

1716
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:49,910
They're almost full.

1717
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:52,540
- Step aboard, miss.  - Go. Go.

1718
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:55,590
Step aboard, please.

1719
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:57,300
You're daddy's good girl, all right?

1720
02:16:57,380 --> 02:16:58,510
You're my little sailor.

1721
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:03,760
Clear the rail, please.

1722
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:06,680
And, lower away!

1723
02:17:20,530 --> 02:17:21,860
You're a good liar.

1724
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:24,450
Almost as good as you.

1725
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,790
There's no... there's no arrangement, is there?

1726
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:35,630
No, there is.

1727
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,130
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1728
02:17:40,050 --> 02:17:41,720
I always win, Jack.

1729
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,470
One way or another.

1730
02:18:42,610 --> 02:18:43,650
Rose!

1731
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:47,030
Stop her!

1732
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:48,780
Rose, what are you doing?!

1733
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:51,870
No!

1734
02:19:14,890 --> 02:19:17,560
Rose! You're so stupid! Why did you do that, huh?

1735
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:19,900
You're so stupid, Rose.

1736
02:19:21,230 --> 02:19:22,900
Why did you do that? Why?!

1737
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,240
You jump, I jump, right?

1738
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:29,110
Right.

1739
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:33,370
Oh God. I couldn't go.

1740
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:35,830
I couldn't go, Jack.

1741
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:37,580
It's all right. We'll think of something.

1742
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:40,750
- At least I'm with you.  - We'll think of something.

1743
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:56,270
Come on! Move!

1744
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,600
Come on! Move.

1745
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,400
Come on!

1746
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,540
Move!

1747
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,300
Come on! Come on, Rose.

1748
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:28,880
Rose, come on!

1749
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:32,930
Move, Rose!

1750
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:37,020
Go!

1751
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:50,320
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1752
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:06,670
What could possibly be funny?

1753
02:21:08,090 --> 02:21:09,840
I put the diamond in the coat.

1754
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,510
And I put the coat on her!

1755
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:17,350
Come on!

1756
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:39,040
Dada!

1757
02:21:41,370 --> 02:21:42,500
We can't leave him.

1758
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:48,380
All right, come on!

1759
02:21:50,050 --> 02:21:52,220
Dada!

1760
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:06,650
Go back!

1761
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:18,530
It's the wrong way! Come back!

1762
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:21,200
No, not that way! Come back! Stop!

1763
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,420
Go!

1764
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:33,420
Go! Run!

1765
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:00,120
This way!

1766
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:13,460
Give me your hand!

1767
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:23,810
Oh, God!

1768
02:23:28,150 --> 02:23:36,490
Help!

1769
02:23:37,950 --> 02:23:39,030
Wait, sir!

1770
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,660
Sir, open the gate, please!

1771
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:42,080
Help us, please!

1772
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:43,490
Help us!

1773
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:44,830
- Please!  - Please!

1774
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:47,830
Bloody hell!

1775
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:55,510
- Come on, come on!  - Come on!

1776
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,170
Go, go!

1777
02:23:57,430 --> 02:23:58,430
Jesus.

1778
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:00,510
- Please!  - Come on!

1779
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,010
Hurry!

1780
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:03,930
Come on!

1781
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:10,270
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1782
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,690
- Wait, please!  - Wait!

1783
02:24:14,030 --> 02:24:16,530
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1784
02:24:35,210 --> 02:24:37,210
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1785
02:24:37,550 --> 02:24:39,550
The short one. Try the short one.

1786
02:24:40,550 --> 02:24:41,550
Hurry, Jack.

1787
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:46,890
Oh no! It won't go in.

1788
02:24:47,810 --> 02:24:48,810
Hurry, Jack.

1789
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,310
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1790
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:56,230
- Come on!  - Hurry, Jack!

1791
02:24:57,900 --> 02:24:59,570
- Hurry, Jack!  - Come on!

1792
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:04,240
I got it! I got it! Go! Go, Rose!

1793
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:06,580
Go! Go!

1794
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:21,260
Jack! Come on!

1795
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,760
Move, move.

1796
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:36,440
- Get those oars in place.  - Get an oar under it.

1797
02:25:41,610 --> 02:25:43,280
Hold it! Hold it!

1798
02:25:43,610 --> 02:25:44,950
Hold it!

1799
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:59,130
Get these davits cranked in! Let's get the falls hooked up!

1800
02:26:11,310 --> 02:26:13,140
Mommy!

1801
02:26:19,820 --> 02:26:20,900
Keep going up!

1802
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:25,660
Stop pushing!

1803
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:29,160
Stay back!

1804
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:31,910
Will you give us a chance to live, you limey bastard!

1805
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:34,660
I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me! Get back!

1806
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:35,920
Bastard!

1807
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:37,670
Get back!

1808
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:38,920
We had a deal, damn you!

1809
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:45,340
Your money can't save you any more than it could save me.

1810
02:26:45,470 --> 02:26:46,470
Get back!

1811
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,600
Women and children only!

1812
02:26:58,520 --> 02:26:59,860
No, Tommy!

1813
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:19,580
No, Will!

1814
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:27,970
Now stand back, damn you!

1815
02:27:31,310 --> 02:27:34,810
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1816
02:27:44,490 --> 02:27:46,150
I have a child!

1817
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:48,610
- I have a child!  - Clear a path here!

1818
02:27:48,990 --> 02:27:50,990
Please, I have a child!

1819
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:54,490
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1820
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:56,500
Go on.

1821
02:27:56,830 --> 02:27:57,830
Step back!

1822
02:27:58,330 --> 02:27:59,670
- Please?  - Here, give her to me.

1823
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:01,790
You're all right, dearie.

1824
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:05,960
Give her here.

1825
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,880
There, there.

1826
02:28:13,180 --> 02:28:16,020
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1827
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:19,520
Oh, Rose.

1828
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:23,860
Won't you even make a try for it?

1829
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:30,360
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.

1830
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:34,530
It's going fast. We have to move.

1831
02:28:34,830 --> 02:28:35,830
Wait.

1832
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:40,330
Good luck to you, Rose.

1833
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:43,380
And to you.

1834
02:28:56,350 --> 02:28:57,390
Mr. Guggenheim?

1835
02:28:57,850 --> 02:28:59,020
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1836
02:28:59,230 --> 02:29:00,230
No, thank you.

1837
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:04,270
We are dressed in our best and are prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1838
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:07,030
But we would like a brandy.

1839
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:10,240
Get the falls over here now!

1840
02:29:10,910 --> 02:29:13,370
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1841
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:19,750
Captain?

1842
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:22,580
Captain, where should I go? Please.

1843
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,930
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1844
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:04,620
Right. That's it, then.

1845
02:30:05,460 --> 02:30:07,090
Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.

1846
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:09,300
- Good-bye, Wallace.  - So long, old chap.

1847
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:29,040
And so they lived happily together for 300 years...

1848
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:31,540
in the land of Tir na nog...

1849
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:35,220
Land of eternal youth and beauty.

1850
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:11,920
There's no time!

1851
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:13,460
Cut those falls!

1852
02:32:13,710 --> 02:32:15,880
Cut them! Cut them if you have to!

1853
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:19,260
I need a knife!

1854
02:32:20,930 --> 02:32:22,600
Cut the falls now!

1855
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:24,600
Cut them loose!

1856
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:36,940
Cut those bloody falls!

1857
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:25,950
Gentlemen...

1858
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:29,120
It has been a privilege playing with you tonight.

1859
02:34:29,930 --> 02:34:31,810
We have to stay on the ship as long as possible.

1860
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:32,980
Come on!

1861
02:34:45,030 --> 02:34:46,700
This way. Through the rail.

1862
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:50,290
Come on, Rose.

1863
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,620
Jump.

1864
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:55,040
Come on.

1865
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:29,910
I got you. Jump.

1866
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:34,410
I've got you, miss.

1867
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:39,420
Back!

1868
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:11,280
No! You'll swamp us!

1869
02:36:24,050 --> 02:36:27,130
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...

1870
02:36:27,470 --> 02:36:30,220
You wanna walk a little faster through that valley there?

1871
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:22,020
Holy Mary, mother of God...

1872
02:37:22,190 --> 02:37:25,150
Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1873
02:37:25,860 --> 02:37:26,940
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1874
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:28,110
This way.

1875
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:40,540
Come on!

1876
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:52,630
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth...

1877
02:37:52,890 --> 02:37:56,390
for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away...

1878
02:37:57,470 --> 02:37:59,060
and there was no more sea.

1879
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:08,650
It'll be over soon. It'll all be over soon.

1880
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:15,740
And He shall dwell with them.

1881
02:38:15,910 --> 02:38:20,330
And they shall be His people and God Himself shall be with them...

1882
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:22,080
and be their God.

1883
02:38:22,830 --> 02:38:23,920
Jack...

1884
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,920
this is where we first met.

1885
02:38:33,970 --> 02:38:37,180
And God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes...

1886
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:39,600
and there shall be no more death.

1887
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:42,600
Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

1888
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:45,600
Neither shall there be any more pain...

1889
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:49,190
for the former world has passed away.

1890
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:05,960
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1891
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:30,570
Hang on, miss Trudy!

1892
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:08,020
Hold on real tight.

1893
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:27,370
God Almighty.

1894
02:40:34,840 --> 02:40:37,380
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1895
02:41:56,380 --> 02:41:57,800
We have to move!

1896
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:05,090
Give me your hand. I'll pull you over.

1897
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:06,140
I can't.

1898
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:07,260
Come on!

1899
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:08,390
Give me your hand.

1900
02:42:10,140 --> 02:42:12,140
I've got you. I won't let go.

1901
02:42:12,730 --> 02:42:13,770
Come on, I've got you.

1902
02:42:24,990 --> 02:42:28,160
- What's happening, Jack?  - I don't know. I don't know.

1903
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:38,340
Hold on.

1904
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:21,880
This is it!

1905
02:43:33,890 --> 02:43:37,560
Oh, my God, Jack! Oh, God. Oh, God.

1906
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:39,560
Hold on!

1907
02:43:54,580 --> 02:43:56,540
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1908
02:43:56,580 --> 02:43:58,790
Take a deep breath when I say.

1909
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:06,590
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1910
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:07,970
Do not let go of my hand.

1911
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:16,930
We're going to make it, Rose.

1912
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:17,980
Trust me.

1913
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:19,350
I trust you.

1914
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:26,440
Ready! Ready!

1915
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:27,950
Now!

1916
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:06,150
Jack! Jack!

1917
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:50,190
Rose!

1918
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:53,030
Get off her! Get off her!

1919
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:58,910
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1920
02:46:03,710 --> 02:46:05,380
Keep swimming.

1921
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,380
It's so cold.

1922
02:46:10,630 --> 02:46:11,970
Swim, Rose!

1923
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:17,890
Come on.

1924
02:46:19,890 --> 02:46:20,980
Keep swimming.

1925
02:46:21,230 --> 02:46:22,560
Come on.

1926
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:25,560
Here...

1927
02:46:25,690 --> 02:46:26,860
get on it.

1928
02:46:27,570 --> 02:46:29,070
Get on top.

1929
02:46:36,450 --> 02:46:37,910
Come on, Rose.

1930
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:49,130
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1931
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:16,490
It'll be all right now.

1932
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:25,000
Return...

1933
02:47:25,210 --> 02:47:26,870
the boats!

1934
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,130
The boats are coming back for us Rose.

1935
02:47:33,670 --> 02:47:35,130
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1936
02:47:36,010 --> 02:47:38,680
They had to row away for the suction...

1937
02:47:38,890 --> 02:47:40,970
but now they'll be coming back.

1938
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:45,350
For God's sake!

1939
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:46,850
Please...

1940
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:48,480
help us!

1941
02:47:53,860 --> 02:47:55,570
You don't understand.

1942
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,570
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.

1943
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:00,160
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1944
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:03,200
Oh, knock it off. You're scaring me.

1945
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:06,040
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1946
02:48:06,330 --> 02:48:09,500
Are you out of your mind? We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1947
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:13,050
Now, do you people want to live or do you want to die?!

1948
02:48:20,010 --> 02:48:22,220
I don't understand a one of you.

1949
02:48:24,060 --> 02:48:25,180
What's the matter with you?

1950
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:27,600
It's your men out there!

1951
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:31,730
There's plenty of room for more.

1952
02:48:32,020 --> 02:48:33,690
And there'll be one less on this boat...

1953
02:48:34,030 --> 02:48:37,400
if you don't shut that hole in your face!

1954
02:48:53,250 --> 02:48:57,380
Now, bring in your oars over there. And tie these boats together as well.

1955
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,100
Now, make sure that's tied up nice and tight.

1956
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:10,270
Right, listen to me, men. We have to go back.

1957
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:14,110
I want to transfer all the women from this boat into that boat right now...

1958
02:49:14,230 --> 02:49:15,400
as quick as you can, please.

1959
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:17,940
Let's create some space over there. Move forward and aft.

1960
02:49:27,950 --> 02:49:29,790
It's getting quiet.

1961
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:35,290
It's just going to take a couple of minutes...

1962
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:37,800
to get the boats organized.

1963
02:49:40,630 --> 02:49:42,300
I don't know about you but...

1964
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:46,140
I intend to write a strongly worded letter...

1965
02:49:46,470 --> 02:49:48,100
to the White Star Line about all this.

1966
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:58,150
I love you, Jack.

1967
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:06,330
Don't you do that.

1968
02:50:07,830 --> 02:50:11,000
Don't you say your good-byes. Not yet.

1969
02:50:11,330 --> 02:50:12,830
Do you understand me?

1970
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:15,000
I'm so cold.

1971
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:17,000
Listen, Rose...

1972
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:19,840
you're gonna get out of here.

1973
02:50:21,010 --> 02:50:22,510
You're gonna go on...

1974
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:25,640
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1975
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:28,350
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1976
02:50:30,020 --> 02:50:31,140
You're gonna die an old...

1977
02:50:31,310 --> 02:50:32,560
an old lady.

1978
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:34,520
Warm in her bed.

1979
02:50:36,190 --> 02:50:37,310
Not here.

1980
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:40,690
Not this night. Not like this.

1981
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:42,690
Do you understand me?

1982
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:47,870
I can't feel my body.

1983
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:50,990
Winning that ticket, Rose...

1984
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:53,750
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

1985
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:57,210
It brought me to you.

1986
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:01,300
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1987
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:03,170
I'm thankful.

1988
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:07,720
You must...

1989
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:10,850
you must do me this honor.

1990
02:51:13,850 --> 02:51:17,350
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1991
02:51:19,360 --> 02:51:21,020
That you won't give up...

1992
02:51:22,190 --> 02:51:24,190
no matter what happens.

1993
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:29,200
No matter how hopeless.

1994
02:51:32,370 --> 02:51:34,540
Promise me now, Rose.

1995
02:51:36,710 --> 02:51:39,040
And never let go of that promise.

1996
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:42,050
I promise.

1997
02:51:44,170 --> 02:51:45,840
Never let go.

1998
02:51:48,720 --> 02:51:50,850
I'll never let go, Jack.

1999
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:55,230
I'll never let go.

2000
02:52:19,330 --> 02:52:20,830
Right ahead, sir.

2001
02:52:24,010 --> 02:52:25,510
Oars!

2002
02:52:26,010 --> 02:52:27,670
Do you see any moving?

2003
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:30,590
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2004
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:32,510
Check them.

2005
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:34,350
Bring that oar up here.

2006
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:42,020
Check them. Make sure.

2007
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:45,070
These are dead, sir.

2008
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:46,740
Now, give way.

2009
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:48,240
Ahead easy.

2010
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:56,540
Careful with your oars.

2011
02:52:57,120 --> 02:52:58,160
Don't hit them.

2012
02:53:00,710 --> 02:53:03,040
Is there anyone alive out there?

2013
02:53:04,550 --> 02:53:06,380
Can anyone hear me?

2014
02:53:08,550 --> 02:53:10,880
Is there anyone alive out there?

2015
02:53:17,730 --> 02:53:18,930
We waited too long.

2016
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:24,610
Well, keep checking them!

2017
02:53:24,730 --> 02:53:26,400
Keep looking!

2018
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:29,740
Is there anyone alive out there?

2019
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:35,240
Can anyone hear me?

2020
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:49,260
Come, Josephine...

2021
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:54,260
in my flying machine

2022
02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:58,970
And it's up she goes

2023
02:54:00,940 --> 02:54:02,940
Up she goes

2024
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:10,610
Come, Josephine...

2025
02:54:12,950 --> 02:54:15,280
in my flying...

2026
02:54:39,140 --> 02:54:59,660
Jack.

2027
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:01,500
There's a boat.

2028
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:16,010
Jack.

2029
02:55:28,520 --> 02:55:30,520
There's a boat, Jack.

2030
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:26,750
Come back.

2031
02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:29,920
Come back. Come back!

2032
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:32,920
Hello!

2033
02:56:35,050 --> 02:56:36,920
Can anyone hear me?

2034
02:56:37,430 --> 02:56:39,090
There's nothing here, sir.

2035
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:45,770
Come back.

2036
02:56:53,610 --> 02:56:55,110
I'll never let go.

2037
02:56:55,360 --> 02:56:56,690
I promise.

2038
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:41,610
Come about!

2039
02:58:02,970 --> 02:58:06,810
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea...

2040
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:10,140
when Titanic sank from under us.

2041
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:15,150
There were twenty boats floating nearby...

2042
02:58:16,320 --> 02:58:18,650
and only one came back.

2043
02:58:20,490 --> 02:58:21,610
One.

2044
02:58:23,320 --> 02:58:25,990
Six were saved from the water...

2045
02:58:26,490 --> 02:58:28,160
myself included.

2046
02:58:29,330 --> 02:58:30,620
Six...

2047
02:58:31,830 --> 02:58:33,710
out of fifteen hundred.

2048
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:38,340
Afterward...

2049
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:41,510
the seven hundred people in the boats...

2050
02:58:42,300 --> 02:58:44,380
had nothing to do but wait.

2051
02:58:46,010 --> 02:58:47,680
Wait to die.

2052
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:49,680
Wait to live.

2053
02:58:50,850 --> 02:58:53,020
Wait for an absolution...

2054
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:55,350
that would never come.

2055
02:59:59,590 --> 03:00:02,050
Sir, I don't think you'll find any of your people down here.

2056
03:00:02,210 --> 03:00:03,630
It's all steerage.

2057
03:00:06,590 --> 03:00:10,140
His hair is reddish brown, reddish brown, reddish brown.

2058
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:11,640
White beard.

2059
03:00:12,100 --> 03:00:13,720
Isn't there another passenger list?

2060
03:00:13,770 --> 03:00:14,890
There is no other list.

2061
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:16,480
Perhaps he's on another ship.

2062
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:18,600
We're doing all we can, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

2063
03:00:41,960 --> 03:00:44,630
That's the last time I ever saw him.

2064
03:00:45,130 --> 03:00:48,630
He married. Of course. And inherited his millions.

2065
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:52,800
But the Crash of '29 hit his interests hard...

2066
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:55,430
and he put a pistol in his mouth that year.

2067
03:00:55,980 --> 03:00:57,810
Or so I read.

2068
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:12,120
Can I take your name please, love?

2069
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:16,490
Dawson.

2070
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,160
Rose Dawson.

2071
03:01:21,500 --> 03:01:22,670
Thank you.

2072
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:31,800
We never found anything on Jack.

2073
03:01:31,970 --> 03:01:33,890
There's no record of him at all.

2074
03:01:34,510 --> 03:01:36,850
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2075
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:39,890
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2076
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:41,690
Not to anyone.

2077
03:01:42,860 --> 03:01:44,860
Not even your grandfather.

2078
03:01:45,190 --> 03:01:49,190
A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.

2079
03:01:50,030 --> 03:01:53,700
But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson...

2080
03:01:54,030 --> 03:01:56,030
and that he saved me...

2081
03:01:56,370 --> 03:01:59,700
in every way that a person can be saved.

2082
03:02:01,710 --> 03:02:04,380
I don't even have a picture of him.

2083
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:10,720
He exists now only in my memory.

2084
03:02:15,550 --> 03:02:19,060
Keldysh, Mir 2 on our way to the surface.

2085
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:38,370
I was saving this for when I found the diamond.

2086
03:02:47,750 --> 03:02:49,250
I'm sorry.

2087
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:53,420
Three years...

2088
03:02:54,090 --> 03:02:56,760
I've thought of nothing except Titanic.

2089
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:59,430
But I never got it.

2090
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:04,440
I never let it in.

2091
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:17,440


2092
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:29,440


2093
03:05:31,440 --> 03:05:42,440


2094
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:54,000
