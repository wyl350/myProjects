1
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,150
Do you, Ethan, take Julia to be your lawful wedded wife?

2
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,980
I do.

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,100
To have, to hold, to love, cherish, honor, and protect?

4
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,290
I do.

5
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,640
To shield from terrors known and unknown?

6
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,140
- To lie, to deceive... - What?

7
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,940
To live a double life, to fail to prevent her abduction,

8
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,830
erase her identity, force her into hiding,

9
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,040
- take away all she has known... - Stop.

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,140
- In a selfish, futile, fleeting attempt... - Stop.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,950
To escape your own true self?

12
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,040
Please, stop.

13
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,800
And, Julia, do you choose to accept?

14
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,710
Don't.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
I do.

16
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,150
No.

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,920
You should have killed me, Ethan.

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,690
Fate whispers to the warrior...

19
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,940
A storm is coming.

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,220
And the warrior whispers back...

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,250
I am the storm.

22
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,780
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

23
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,890
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

24
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,260
Since you captured him 2 years ago,

25
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,190
his absence from the world stage has had unintended consequences.

26
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,400
His Syndicate of rogue covert operatives

27
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,840
continues to wreak havoc around the globe.

28
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,850
The CIA's Special Activities Division

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,090
has relentlessly hunted Lane's elite network of hostiles.

30
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,580
But many remain unknown and at large.

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,570
The remnants of this extremist splinter cell

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,290
refer to themselves as "The Apostles."

33
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,160
They have since adopted a policy of terror-for-hire,

34
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,400
making them an even greater threat.

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,260
They are responsible for the recent smallpox outbreak

36
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,620
in Indian-controlled Kashmir,

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,930
along the borders of China and Pakistan,

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,420
threatening one-third of the world's population.

39
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,470
The epidemic is being contained,

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,000
but intelligence would indicate

41
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,000
that a new client has hired the Apostles

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,230
for a more ambitious operation.

43
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,320
They have been contacted by this man,

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,680
an unidentified extremist

45
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,200
known only by the code name John Lark,

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,320
author of this apocalyptic manifesto

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,380
calling for the destruction of the current world order.

48
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
It is believed Lark is responsible for the disappearance

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,980
of Norwegian nuclear weapons specialist Nils Delbruuk.

50
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,160
Dr. Delbruuk's security clearance was revoked

51
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,170
after he expressed fiercely anti-religious views.

52
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,240
Meanwhile, the Apostles have been in contact

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,480
with elements of the Eastern European underworld,

54
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,850
who are in possession of three plutonium cores

55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,640
stolen from a missile base in eastern Russia.

56
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,990
This would indicate that John Lark and the Apostles

57
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,380
are working together to acquire functioning nuclear weapons.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,370
NEST estimates that a man with Delbruuk's knowledge,

59
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,960
using the materials in play,

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,890
could complete three nuclear weapons in as little as 72 hours.

61
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,970
These devices would be man-portable

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,660
and deployable anywhere on Earth overnight.

63
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,250
In the hands of John Lark and the Apostles,

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,680
these weapons represent an unprecedented threat

65
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,480
to countless millions.

66
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,380
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,900
is to prevent the Apostles from acquiring plutonium

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,150
using any means at your disposal.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,400
If you or any members of your IMF team are caught or killed,

70
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,590
the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,700
Good luck, Ethan.

72
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,840
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

73
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,190
He's late.

74
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,120
He's never late.

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,390
He'll be here.

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,930
I don't like it.

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,550
Something about this guy just really gives me the creeps.

78
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,490
Okay, just relax.

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,010
I'm relaxed.

80
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,350
You don't sound relaxed.

81
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,220
Luther, does he sound relaxed to you?

82
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,780
He sounds terrified.

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
Please, I'm not terrified.

84
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,580
I just have a bad feeling is all.

85
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,390
I thought you said you were relaxed.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,780
It's entirely possible to be relaxed and extremely uneasy

87
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,970
at the same time.

88
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,890
- No, it's not. - You do it all the time.

89
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,460
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.

90
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,310
No, he doesn't.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,510
I'm supposed to believe that you are perfectly relaxed,

92
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,940
- right here, now... - Benji.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,380
In a dark alleyway, waiting to buy black-market plutonium

94
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,520
from a psychopath. - Benji,

95
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,300
I won't let anything happen to you.

96
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,160
- Okay. - See, Benji, you're perfectly safe.

97
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,740
That's easy for you to say, you're in the van.

98
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,860
Well, you wanted to be in the field, tough guy.

99
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,000
And tonight, Luther, I would like to be in the van!

100
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,270
He's here.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,010
Oh, God.

102
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,170
Have that money ready, Luther.

103
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,240
Copy.

104
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,560
Ethan, do you copy?

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,860
Do you copy?

106
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
Are we finally gonna do this or not?

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,780
I have survived in this business

108
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,060
with the help of a voice in my head.

109
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,720
This voice is never wrong.

110
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,470
And whenever I meet you,

111
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,050
it tells me the same thing.

112
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,710
What's that?

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,820
Nothing.

114
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,470
I'm here to do business.

115
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,700
Tell the voice to flip a coin.

116
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,350
What's that?

117
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,820
This is a beryllium rod,

118
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,670
which is causing a reaction with the plutonium inside the core.

119
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,750
That's them.

120
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,950
The money?

121
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,310
The money.

122
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,620
Bring the money.

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,760
Luther, bring the money.

124
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,480
We're gonna need that money, Luther.

125
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Kill them.

126
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,810
I got it!

127
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,470
Luther, do you copy?

128
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,340
Luther!

129
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,960
Luther, come in.

130
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,200
Luther's not here right now.

131
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,420
What can the Apostles do for you, Hunt?

132
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,670
What do you want?

133
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,340
You're boxed in, Hunt.

134
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,540
Give us the plutonium and walk away.

135
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,140
Benji, get the car.

136
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,590
I don't think I can do that.

137
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,150
Benji, get the car.

138
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,340
We'll make you a deal, Hunt.

139
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,080
Give us the plutonium and we won't kill your friend.

140
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,950
Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!

141
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,940
I'm gonna count to three.

142
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,360
One.

143
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,360
- Two. - Luther...

144
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,840
- I'm sorry. - Three.

145
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,270
I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.

146
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,380
We're good.

147
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,390
You okay?

148
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,870
I should be dead.

149
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,390
We should all be dead.

150
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,720
Why aren't we?

151
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,140
Where's the plutonium?

152
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,260
It's gone.

153
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,350
If you're just joining us,

154
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,730
three massive explosions have gone off simultaneously

155
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,460
in what appears to be a coordinated attack.

156
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,690
This image is live in Rome, looking toward the Vatican

157
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,120
and is as close as our cameras can get.

158
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,360
It is believed that the Pope was in residence

159
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,640
at the time of the blast.

160
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,820
Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem from just outside the city.

161
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,250
Also live, the holy city of Mecca

162
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,810
from the USS Ronald Reagan in the Red Sea

163
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,070
off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

164
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,140
Radiation has been detected,

165
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,380
indicating that nuclear weapons were used

166
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,210
in these unspeakable attacks.

167
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,430
- Ethan, it's time. - No word on casualties yet,

168
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,640
but we can assume

169
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,660
the death toll is catastrophic.

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,970
Early reports suggest the weapons used

171
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,620
would require highly specialized knowledge

172
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,730
that very few people possess.

173
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,650
The question now is who would attack all three of these holy sites?

174
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,880
And why?

175
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,980
The attacks occurred at precisely the same moment,

176
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,440
just over an hour ago,

177
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,210
at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

178
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,650
Within minutes of the attack,

179
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,140
Congress ordered an emergency recess

180
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,210
and the Capitol Building was evacuated.

181
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,890
The President left Washington on Air Force One.

182
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,380
The White House has declared a state of emergency,

183
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,790
placing the military on highest alert.

184
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,880
Would you excuse us, please?

185
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,230
Dr. Delbruuk.

186
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,200
We know who you are.

187
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,020
We read the manifesto, we found your lab.

188
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,980
"There has never been peace

189
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,850
"without first a great suffering.

190
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,610
"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."

191
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,750
See, this will unite them. Hmm?

192
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,750
When they read this manifesto, they'll all understand.

193
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,420
Nobody's gonna read that manifesto, ever.

194
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,220
I can promise you that.

195
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,760
What day is it?

196
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,400
How long have I been here?

197
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,590
What's the last thing you remember?

198
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,200
I was driving.

199
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,660
Someone hit me.

200
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,120
That was two weeks ago.

201
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,470
- Two weeks? - Two weeks.

202
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,400
This is yours, isn't it?

203
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
It's how Lark communicated with you.

204
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,110
- Lark? - John Lark.

205
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,270
- We know all about him. - You know nothing.

206
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,110
There's information in this phone that could lead us to him.

207
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,950
And you have the passcode.

208
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,140
You think Lark is the enemy, hmm?

209
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,300
But you,

210
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,660
well, whoever you are, you are the enemy.

211
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,140
You're why the system survives.

212
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,490
- Why the suffering goes on. - Shut up!

213
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,320
We don't care about you. We want Lark.

214
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,410
What if we make a deal?

215
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,280
No, there's no deal, Luther.

216
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,670
Step outside.

217
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,320
Give me five minutes with this guy.

218
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,720
Ethan, I can't let you do that. That's not who we are.

219
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,200
Then maybe we need to reconsider that.

220
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,100
What if they read the manifesto on the air?

221
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,120
What? You can do that?

222
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,090
We can do it with a phone call.

223
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,720
Well, if he reads Lark's manifesto...

224
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,590
No.

225
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,750
I'll give you the passcode.

226
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,870
Ethan! Ethan!

227
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,400
Think, Ethan.

228
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,510
Think of the greater good, please.

229
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah, you do that.

230
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,760
Sir.

231
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,930
No, he won't cooperate.

232
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,860
Yes, sir.

233
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,210
If we read the manifesto

234
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,280
on the air.

235
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,370
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,540
Trading and global markets plummeted.

237
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,200
Stand by. I'm told

238
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,290
we're about to get some additional information.

239
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,080
I've just been handed a document from Nils Delbruuk,

240
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,230
a nuclear weapons specialist

241
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,860
who claims to have built the weapons used in these attacks.

242
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,800
I've been asked to read this manifesto in its entirety.

243
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,470
"There has never been peace without first a great suffering."

244
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,580
"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."

245
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,780
"As mankind is drawn to his self-destruction"

246
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,620
"like a moth to the candle,"

247
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,510
"the so-called defenders of peace,"

248
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,450
"the church, the government, the law,"

249
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,620
"work tirelessly to save humanity from itself."

250
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,360
It's not gonna help you now.

251
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,090
"But by averting disaster,"

252
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,800
"they serve to delay a peace..."

253
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,730
What's done is done.

254
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,010
"that can only come through an inevitable baptism of fire."

255
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,570
"The suffering I bring you is not the beginning of the end."

256
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,270
"It is the beginning of a greater mutual understanding..."

257
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,560
Did we get it?

258
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,580
"It is the first step toward the ultimate brotherhood of man."

259
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,590
We got it.

260
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,350
"The suffering I bring you"

261
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,390
"is the bridge to ultimate peace."

262
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,730
Go.

263
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,600
Did we get it?

264
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,470
Of course we got it.

265
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,480
I told you we'd get it.

266
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,900
I don't understand.

267
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,850
The attacks didn't happen?

268
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,750
The car accident you were in, that was an hour ago.

269
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,820
I was driving the other car.

270
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,110
What's done is done,

271
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,090
when we say it's done.

272
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,750
Sir.

273
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,240
That phone you unlocked led us to a server in Iceland

274
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,050
where we managed to decrypt a communique

275
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,580
between John Lark and this woman:

276
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,470
Alana Mitsopolis, activist and philanthropist,

277
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,400
whose charity work

278
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,000
has earned her the nickname the White Widow.

279
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,750
It's all a front for her real trade:

280
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,610
arms dealing, money laundering.

281
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,180
Extensive political connections provide her with protection.

282
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,780
Lark and the Widow are meeting tonight

283
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,890
to negotiate delivery of an unspecified package,

284
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,730
which we can only assume is our missing plutonium.

285
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,990
They'll make contact in a private lounge at the Grand Palais in Paris

286
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,300
during her annual fundraising event.

287
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,770
The details are in the file.

288
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,510
If Lark isn't there by midnight,

289
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,880
the Widow will leave

290
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,850
and sell the package to the highest bidder.

291
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,540
Which gives you two hours from now to find Lark.

292
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,780
Sir, I think there's something you need to know.

293
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,560
- I... - I'm gonna stop you right there

294
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,200
You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin:

295
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,240
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

296
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,070
You chose your team, and now the world is at risk.

297
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,100
Some flaw deep in your core being

298
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,700
simply won't allow you to choose between one life and millions.

299
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,330
You see that as a sign of weakness.

300
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
To me, that's your greatest strength.

301
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,940
It also tells me I can count on you to cover my ass.

302
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,160
Because coming over here from the CIA was a lateral move,

303
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,200
some say a step down.

304
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,630
But I did it

305
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,510
because of you.

306
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,820
Don't make me regret it.

307
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,260
Make the call.

308
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,010
Shut 'em down.

309
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,340
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
It may be your mission,

311
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,970
but this is the CIA's plane.

312
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,880
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

313
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,050
We don't have time for this.

314
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,820
I have a team in Paris ready to grab

315
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,630
Lark as soon as he leaves the building.

316
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,620
A G5 standing by to rendition him to Gitmo,

317
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,990
where a waterboard is waiting.

318
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,600
Spend 24 hours we don't have to pull a confession we can't trust

319
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,640
from a man we haven't positively identified? No.

320
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,550
We need reliable intelligence, and we need it now.

321
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,320
This scenario is precisely why the IMF exists!

322
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,540
The IMF is Halloween, Alan.

323
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,120
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick-or-treat.

324
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,040
And if he had held on to the plutonium in Berlin,

325
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,130
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,670
And his team would be dead.

327
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,580
Yes. They would.

328
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,260
That's the job.

329
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,460
And that's why I want one of my own men on the scene

330
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,720
to appraise the situation.

331
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,380
Agent Walker, Special Activities.

332
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,640
His reputation precedes.

333
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,630
You use a scalpel.

334
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,220
I prefer a hammer.

335
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,710
The answer is no.

336
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,500
I have operational authority here, direct from the President.

337
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,010
You have a problem with that, you take it up with him.

338
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,820
I have already, and he agrees with me.

339
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,340
My man goes or no one goes.

340
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,490
No one comes between you and that plutonium.

341
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,990
Not Hunt, not his team, not anyone.

342
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,270
The White Widow has spies at every level of government.

343
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,520
This plane is posing as a commercial airliner

344
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,180
so we can jump into France undetected.

345
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,080
The Widow's meeting Lark in the VIP lounge at midnight.

346
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,560
No one will be admitted without a pre-issued electronic I.D. band.

347
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,200
We have acquired the unique RFID number for Lark's band,

348
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,060
allowing us to locate it

349
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,680
with these.

350
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,490
you find Lark.

351
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,870
you find Lark.

352
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,130
Then what?

353
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,320
Then...

354
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,540
I assume his identity and make contact with the Widow.

355
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,420
She takes us to the package.

356
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,200
People actually fall for this shit?

357
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,600
How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?

358
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,310
I bump him in the crowd.

359
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,560
In ten seconds he'll look like any other drunk at the party,

360
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,790
incoherent and completely pliable.

361
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,140
After I borrow his face,

362
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,300
you walk him out the front door

363
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,140
and hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

364
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,140
You're not getting rid of me that easily, Hunt.

365
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,700
That's not what this is about.

366
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,210
Sure it is.

367
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,340
I know you don't want me on this detail.

368
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,110
But let's face it:

369
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,190
If you'd made the hard choice in Berlin,

370
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,640
I wouldn't be here.

371
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,870
And if you hadn't gunned down

372
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,420
every Syndicate agent they sent you to find,

373
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,020
I wouldn't be here.

374
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,320
That's right, I know all about you.

375
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,020
You're why we don't have a living witness

376
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,930
who can identify John Lark or the Apostles.

377
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,660
If you have a problem with my methods,

378
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,540
you can always stay behind.

379
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,470
"Your mission, should you choose to accept it."

380
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,110
Isn't that the thing?

381
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,770
Two minutes to decompression.

382
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,950
Suit up.

383
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,640
The Widow is meeting Lark in 30 minutes.

384
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,160
Ten seconds to decompression.

385
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,180
Is your oxygen on?

386
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,090
There is no atmosphere at this altitude.

387
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,110
I don't need you blacking out on me.

388
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,720
Your heads-up display has a built-in guidance system.

389
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,280
Follow it to the target.

390
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,850
Open your chute when the system says,

391
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,760
not before and definitely not after,

392
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,430
or the last thing that goes through your mind

393
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

394
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,310
Crystal.

395
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,760
We got to talk. We need to rethink this.

396
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,020
Out of my way, Hunt.

397
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,110
Walker, we've got a problem.

398
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,610
There's a storm. We need to...

399
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,190
Enough talk.

400
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,800
I'll see you in Paris.

401
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,120
Come on, come on, come on.

402
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,850
Altitude: 25,000 feet.

403
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,550
Walker?

404
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,020
What's the matter, Hunt?

405
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,260
You afraid of a little lightning?

406
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,390
Altitude: 20,000 feet.

407
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,030
Son of a bitch.

408
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,080
Walker?

409
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,980
Do you copy?

410
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,640
Walker?

411
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,840
Walker.

412
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,280
Come on.

413
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,520
Altitude: 15,000 feet.

414
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,590
Walker.

415
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,600
Walker!

416
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,790
Walker!

417
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
Walker!

418
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,190
Altitude: 10,000 feet.

419
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,520
9,000.

420
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,680
Oh, shit.

421
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,460
8,000.

422
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,030
7,000.

423
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,790
6,000.

424
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,500
5,000.

425
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,840
4,000.

426
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,090
Walker!

427
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,610
Walker!

428
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,500
3,000.

429
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,980
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

430
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,920
Deploy. Deploy.

431
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,820
Oh, God.

432
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,530
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

433
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,640
That's where the Widow is meeting Lark.

434
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,280
Ethan.

435
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,760
- Walker. - Ethan, if you can hear me,

436
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,060
I've got him.

437
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,230
Say again. Where?

438
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
He's headed for the bathroom.

439
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,320
- Where's the needle? - Didn't need it.

440
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,540
Get him up.

441
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,830
Shit.

442
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,420
- Can you still make a mask? - I need a face to make a mask.

443
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,680
Sorry.

444
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,980
I was aiming for his chest.

445
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,530
What are you doing here?

446
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,600
It's good to see you, too.

447
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,270
I'm sorry, I'm confused. You are...

448
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,400
An old friend.

449
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,020
Cancel extraction. We're code blue.

450
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,570
Send sanitation.

451
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,200
North men's room.

452
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,390
You didn't answer my question.

453
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,730
What are you doing here?

454
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,430
That's it. Just take it easy. That's it.

455
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,400
Just keep your head back until the bleeding stops.

456
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,690
What is it? Eh?

457
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,230
You're not here by accident.

458
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,210
Who sent you?

459
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,400
I can't tell you that.

460
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,440
What are you doing?

461
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,750
I have a date with the White Widow.

462
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,160
He had a date with the Widow.

463
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,780
You look nothing like him.

464
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,060
And now we have to hope they never met.

465
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,700
Hope is not a strategy!

466
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,170
Oh, you must be new.

467
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,170
I have no other choice.

468
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,790
The White Widow's our only lead.

469
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,700
I got to be this guy for five minutes.

470
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,580
- Don't do it. - What?

471
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,700
What is it? What aren't you telling me?

472
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,100
You don't understand what you're involved in.

473
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,250
I don't understand what I'm involved in.

474
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,640
I don't understand what I'm involved in?

475
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
What am I involved in?

476
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,480
If you're meeting the Widow, she leaves in three minutes.

477
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,660
- Ethan! - I'll make it work.

478
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,560
- Ethan! - I'll make it work.

479
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,160
The name's Walker.

480
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,350
Yeah?

481
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,670
You're welcome.

482
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,780
What do you think you're doing?

483
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,510
- I'm going with you. - Like hell you are.

484
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,140
People have been sent here to kill Lark.

485
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,840
No shit.

486
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,440
No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.

487
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,760
They don't know what he looks like,

488
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,530
they only know he's meeting the Widow at midnight.

489
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,770
If you go through with this,

490
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,820
they're gonna believe you're Lark

491
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,250
and they're gonna kill you.

492
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,070
How do you know all this?

493
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,930
I can't tell you that.

494
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,340
You should've stayed out of the game.

495
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,400
You should've come with me.

496
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,380
This charity was started in honor of my mother.

497
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,180
Those of you who knew her understood her strength,

498
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,110
her tenacity, her resourcefulness.

499
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,470
But there was another side to her,

500
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,000
a side most people never saw.

501
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,780
It is that part of her spirit that has brought us

502
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,570
all together tonight.

503
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,040
Max was something of a paradox.

504
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,430
She had a fascination for paradoxes,

505
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,580
a fascination she passed on to me.

506
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,430
Max had no illusions about the world we live in today.

507
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,450
But she had dreams of a very different future.

508
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,160
One in which her unique talents were no longer required.

509
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,710
All she earned from the way the world is

510
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,390
went ultimately to making it what it could someday be.

511
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,400
That future isn't here yet.

512
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,720
Tonight, your contributions

513
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,490
have brought it just a little closer.

514
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,630
Thank you all for coming.

515
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,490
Enjoy the party.

516
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,840
You can't possibly be John Lark.

517
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
I'm not, actually.

518
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,920
It's an alias.

519
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,560
I suppose it's better than John Doe.

520
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,230
Is there another name you prefer?

521
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,650
Is there somewhere we could talk privately?

522
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,280
In fact I like "Lark." It does have a certain ring.

523
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,380
We don't have a lot of time.

524
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,420
'Cause I'll be honest with you.

525
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,970
A man of your reputation, I was expecting someone uglier.

526
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,890
Don't let looks deceive. I'm as ugly as they come.

527
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,840
And I'll be honest with you. Your life is in danger.

528
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,220
Don't you touch her.

529
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,460
Relax. It's my brother.

530
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,310
You're being rude to our guest, Zola.

531
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,680
It's time to go.

532
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,590
Don't turn this into a scene.

533
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,130
You don't want to be with this one.

534
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,680
You were saying?

535
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,440
Your life is in danger.

536
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,540
And who would want to kill me?

537
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,170
The Americans, for starters.

538
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,670
If that were true, I would know it.

539
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,730
You think you're the only one

540
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,360
with spies in the government?

541
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,700
There are people here who don't want this meeting to happen.

542
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,320
Don't believe me?

543
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,150
Look around.

544
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,950
I know what you're thinking.

545
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,300
Maybe they're not here for you.

546
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,480
Maybe they're just here for me.

547
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,110
Are you willing to take that chance?

548
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,810
You have something I want.

549
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,490
Right now, that makes me the only person you can trust

550
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
to get you out of here alive.

551
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,190
Or would you rather leave that to your brother?

552
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,470
I think I'd like to go home now,

553
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,990
Mr. Lark.

554
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,790
The French government took receipt of the asset at noon today.

555
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,340
Delivery will be via air to the Finance Ministry

556
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,030
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

557
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,920
An armored motorcade under heavy police escort

558
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,030
will transport him via this route.

559
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,720
We'll create a diversion at this intersection, here.

560
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,400
The motorcade will automatically take

561
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
the preplanned alternate route here,

562
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,120
where we'll extract the asset.

563
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,120
Extract the asset?

564
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,600
The asset.

565
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,480
We paid a great deal of money for this information.

566
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,090
They gave us everything but this man's name.

567
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,720
You don't happen to know who he is, do you?

568
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,680
His name is Solomon Lane.

569
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,500
British Special Agent turned anarchist.

570
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,510
He used rogue covert operatives

571
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,160
to create a terror network called the Syndicate.

572
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,070
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

573
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,070
As ugly as they come.

574
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,200
He was captured by American agents two years ago.

575
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,460
Since then, he's been in a never-ending interrogation,

576
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,400
passed around from one government to another

577
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,190
to answer for his crimes.

578
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,260
You seem displeased, Lark.

579
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,230
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

580
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,730
I came to Paris for plutonium.

581
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,890
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

582
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,110
I'm just a broker.

583
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,780
I connect a buyer and a seller.

584
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,030
My seller's not interested in cash,

585
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,010
so if you want the plutonium...

586
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,320
Extract Lane

587
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,650
and make a trade.

588
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,350
That's right.

589
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,270
How do I know the seller has what I want?

590
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,680
A down payment in good faith.

591
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,480
A courier will deliver two more within 48 hours

592
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
in exchange for him.

593
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,720
All right.

594
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,480
What happens after the diversion?

595
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,610
Kill everyone?

596
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,410
That's your plan?

597
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,430
There will be no witnesses.

598
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,800
What's my guarantee that lane walks out of this thing alive?

599
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,660
He's in an armored box.

600
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,060
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

601
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,170
You want your plutonium,

602
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,900
this is the price.

603
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,590
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

604
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,010
That's John Lark you're talking to.

605
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,000
I murder women and children with smallpox.

606
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,120
I have no line.

607
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,500
Right.

608
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,490
Sleep well, everyone.

609
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,130
Busy day tomorrow.

610
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,230
You have got to be kidding me.

611
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,170
If you want Lane out of prison, this is how it gets done.

612
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,830
I wanted Lark to break him out, not Ethan Hunt.

613
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:00,170
I wanted Lark at the exchange, not Ethan Hunt.

614
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,290
I wanted Lark to lead us to the plutonium

615
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,950
and the Apostles.

616
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,650
You may still get your chance.

617
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,620
Have you forgotten about the corpse we pulled

618
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,250
out of the men's room at the Grand Palais?

619
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,060
I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.

620
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,480
More likely one of Lark's recruits.

621
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
Not according to our intelligence.

622
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,920
Intelligence gathered by whom?

623
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,390
Hunt.

624
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,570
You've long held suspicions that Lark was an American agent.

625
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,590
Someone who knew our every move.

626
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,870
Someone who could come and go like a ghost.

627
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,250
You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark.

628
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,260
You're reaching, Walker. Trying to save your ass.

629
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,880
It won't work.

630
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,260
Think about it.

631
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,500
Would a man as careful as Lark

632
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,410
really stick his neck out like that?

633
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,780
For a face-to-face with the White Widow?

634
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,470
- He'd send a proxy. - A decoy.

635
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,280
And if he was really smart,

636
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,800
he'd have his lady friend

637
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,050
kill that decoy in front of a reliable witness. Me.

638
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,840
The dragnet is closing in on his terrorist alter ego.

639
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,600
So he pays a man to play the part of Lark

640
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,170
and has him killed.

641
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,240
And under the guise of serving his country...

642
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,870
Assumes his own secret identity.

643
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,430
Free to operate at will with the full support of the U.S. government.

644
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,590
Why?

645
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,790
Why would Hunt turn?

646
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,420
Why did Lane do it? Why did any of his Apostles?

647
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,500
They were believers in a cause.

648
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,340
And when that cause turned out to be a lie,

649
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,780
they turned against their masters.

650
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,410
How many times has Hunt's government betrayed him,

651
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,510
disavowed him, cast him aside?

652
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,030
And how long before a man like that has had enough?

653
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,400
That is a serious accusation.

654
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,520
Can you prove it?

655
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,260
This is the phone we pulled off the dead body

656
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,840
at the Grand Palais.

657
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,320
I'm guessing it has all the proof you need.

658
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,620
Is it true Lane gassed a village of 2,000 people?

659
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,020
Yes.

660
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,880
Is it true he brought down an entire passenger plane

661
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,520
just to kill one man?

662
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,390
Yes.

663
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,810
- Is it true that he... - Hey, Walker.

664
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,280
Whatever you heard,

665
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,810
if it makes your skin crawl,

666
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,330
it's probably true.

667
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,570
Holy shit.

668
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,750
You're the guy that caught him, aren't you?

669
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,560
How long do you think he's gonna keep that to himself?

670
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,840
We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.

671
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,070
What the hell is he doing?

672
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,570
Hunt? Where are you?

673
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,950
Don't wait for me!

674
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,110
What is it? What's wrong?

675
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,890
I'll meet you at the garage.

676
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,110
Benji, do you copy?

677
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,640
We copy. Go.

678
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,790
Change of plan. I'm blown. Need extraction.

679
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,130
We're on our way.

680
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,750
Get in the car.

681
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,120
Zola wants a word with you.

682
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,170
We got to go.

683
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,720
Come on.

684
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,410
The name's Walker, by the way.

685
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,760
Was the little car your idea?

686
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,720
Jesus Christ!

687
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,620
What the hell was that?

688
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,170
- Everybody out. - Go, go, go!

689
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,030
That was Ilsa.

690
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,530
Shut up.

691
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,570
Very interesting.

692
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,410
It's good to see you again, Ethan.

693
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,290
Oh, look who's still alive.

694
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,070
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.

695
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:47,490
Got it. You know what to do.

696
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:51,030
Let me just assure you, this won't hurt...enough.

697
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,620
Ninety seconds.

698
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,240
You and your Apostles think

699
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,630
we're gonna trade you for the missing plutonium.

700
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,500
I'm here to tell you that's never gonna happen.

701
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,740
"Your mission, should you choose to accept it."

702
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,390
I wonder, Ethan,

703
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,480
did you ever choose not to?

704
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,960
Did you ever stop and ask yourself

705
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,650
who it was giving you the orders or why?

706
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,100
While every day the master you serve

707
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:20,830
moves one step closer to ending the world.

708
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,230
Strange accusation coming from a terrorist.

709
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,110
Sixty seconds.

710
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,650
Terrorists are schoolboys desperate for attention,

711
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:29,730
hoping to shape public opinion through fear.

712
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,350
I don't care in the least what people think or feel.

713
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,550
In my experience, they don't do either for very long.

714
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,510
Oh, and I suppose that justifies bombing factories

715
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,360
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

716
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,850
Or strapping me into an explosive vest!

717
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,970
Consider it unfinished business, my funny little friend.

718
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,970
- Luther? - Almost there.

719
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:50,220
You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan.

720
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,010
Governments the world over are descending into madness.

721
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,240
The Syndicate was created to tear them down, brick by brick.

722
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,390
The Syndicate was a pack of murdering cowards.

723
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:02,640
The Syndicate was civilization's last hope!

724
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,290
A chance to smash the old world order.

725
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,210
That hope is gone now

726
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,880
because of you and your pathetic morality.

727
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,750
You should have killed me, Ethan.

728
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,180
The end you've always feared

729
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,840
is coming.

730
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,680
It's coming!

731
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:30,560
And the blood will be on your hands.

732
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:38,270
The fallout of all your good intentions.

733
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,370
Time.

734
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:46,620
Got it.

735
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,320
Get him up.

736
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,690
You're mine now.

737
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,920
You're just full of surprises, Lark.

738
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,570
Your brother's plan was bad from the word go.

739
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,460
You'd have lost all your men

740
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,960
and Lane would've been killed in the crossfire.

741
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,810
I had to improvise.

742
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,860
Well, why not say that in the first place?

743
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,830
Because I don't trust your people.

744
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,160
Especially not your brother.

745
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,990
Family. What can you do?

746
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,470
So, where's Lane?

747
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:58,170
Certainly not at the bottom of the Seine.

748
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:00,100
I have him. He's safe.

749
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:02,560
Where do I meet the courier?

750
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,120
Let's talk about the woman.

751
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,110
Woman?

752
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,690
She was with you at the Palais.

753
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,460
Zola saw her again today.

754
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,830
She tried to kill Lane.

755
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,030
She had the chance to kill you, but she didn't.

756
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,000
Why?

757
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,010
We have a past.

758
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,970
It's complicated.

759
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,260
Well, I'll make it more complicated for you.

760
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,550
My price just went up.

761
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,860
Someone killed four of my men today.

762
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,590
I'm assuming it was her.

763
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,960
I want her, Lark.

764
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,570
And you're gonna bring her to me.

765
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,270
Otherwise, you don't meet the courier

766
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,640
and the plutonium goes to the highest bidder.

767
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,610
I'd hate for her to come between us.

768
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,230
She's yours.

769
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,750
At the meeting. Not before.

770
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,120
Go to London.

771
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,020
Instructions will follow.

772
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,400
I knew if I followed her, you'd show up eventually.

773
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,050
Are you okay?

774
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:14,010
- Ilsa, I never wanted to hurt you. - I know you have your reasons.

775
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:15,920
I know.

776
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,440
You need to walk away.

777
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:23,360
I can't do that.

778
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:27,060
You weren't at the Palais to kill Lark.

779
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,550
No.

780
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,820
You were there to protect him.

781
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:33,520
Yes.

782
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,920
And you killed him to protect me.

783
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:40,100
You wanted Lark to break Lane out.

784
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,790
No, you needed him to break Lane out.

785
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,710
Because you have to kill Lane.

786
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,120
Who's making you do this?

787
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,320
MI6.

788
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,130
Why?

789
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,130
After we captured him in London,

790
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,190
they tried to bring Lane home through diplomatic channels.

791
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:06,080
But too many countries want their pound of flesh.

792
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:08,290
A man like that, what he's seen,

793
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,080
what he knows about British Intelligence,

794
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,940
they can't have him talking to a foreign government ever.

795
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,010
That's not what I'm asking.

796
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,870
Why did they send you?

797
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,600
This is how I prove my loyalty.

798
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,210
This is how I come home.

799
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,660
But you were out.

800
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,370
You were free.

801
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:28,180
We are never free.

802
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,810
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

803
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,520
To them, I'm as much of a threat as he is.

804
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,460
I kill him,

805
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,460
or I never stop running.

806
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:43,890
Now tell me where he is.

807
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,090
I can't help you.

808
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,390
I will get to him one way or another.

809
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,580
Please don't make me go through you.

810
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,140
Yes.

811
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,790
Are you here in London?

812
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:56,910
I am.

813
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,260
Are you ready to meet the courier?

814
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,120
Yes. Where do I go?

815
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,000
Where would you like to meet?

816
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,810
Mr. Secretary.

817
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:46,640
I prayed to God that it wasn't true.

818
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,520
Well, in his defense, sir,

819
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,120
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

820
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,420
a great many people would have been killed.

821
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,600
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that the good people of Paris

822
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,650
and the nation of France as a whole will take that into account.

823
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,550
So what the hell happened?

824
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:21,620
At which point, we were told to come to London

825
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,730
and await further instructions.

826
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:25,260
And what happens now?

827
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,150
Now,

828
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,760
we meet the Widow in 20 minutes.

829
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,170
She'll take us to a courier

830
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:34,450
who'll hand over our missing plutonium in exchange for Solomon Lane.

831
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,040
Or, in our scenario,

832
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:38,350
Benji.

833
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,260
Jesus.

834
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,490
I'm sorry, what?

835
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,120
Luther and I are gonna take you to the courier.

836
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,860
Walker stays here and guards the real Lane.

837
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,970
Absolutely not.

838
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,720
Wait, wait. Why do I have to be Lane?

839
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,520
Benji.

840
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,510
Our mission, my mission, is to recover that plutonium,

841
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,750
and I will do so at any cost.

842
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,430
Even if I have to trade Lane.

843
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,900
The real Lane.

844
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,030
And I will never let him go.

845
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,030
When the Apostles realize that you're playing games,

846
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,620
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

847
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,540
You let us worry about the Apostles.

848
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,190
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

849
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,600
A bigger problem?

850
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,900
- Ilsa. - Ilsa?

851
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,460
Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?

852
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,770
How is she mixed up in all of this?

853
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:18,080
She's been ordered to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

854
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,960
Look, wait. So that was her in Paris?

855
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:22,420
- On the bike. - Yeah.

856
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,940
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

857
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,350
- No, not us. Not us. - Yeah.

858
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,700
Lane. She tried to kill Lane. She has no choice.

859
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:28,720
And she will kill me!

860
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,710
I'm not gonna let that happen.

861
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:32,140
Ethan, how exactly are you not gonna let that happen?

862
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,910
I'm working on it.

863
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:35,990
Oh, he's working on it.

864
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,170
Right now, we don't have a lot of time.

865
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,930
We have to start getting ready for this meeting.

866
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,440
The meeting is a trap.

867
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,710
The White Widow is working with the CIA.

868
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,620
She has been since the beginning.

869
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:48,940
Bargaining for immunity is her stock-in-trade.

870
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,990
Capturing the plutonium, and the Apostles, and John Lark

871
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,970
buys her a lot of goodwill with the Americans.

872
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,510
But if Sloane knew the meeting was a trap,

873
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,610
why didn't she just tell us?

874
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,600
Because, in her mind, anybody could be John Lark,

875
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,160
including one of us.

876
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:04,870
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

877
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,420
According to that dossier,

878
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,200
a trail of electronic evidence connects Hunt

879
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,020
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

880
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,820
It also links him to a lengthy correspondence

881
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,960
ending with the recruitment of Dr. Delbruuk.

882
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:21,300
And, of course, Hunt handed over the plutonium

883
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,040
to the Apostles himself.

884
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,100
Now, those facts, coupled with

885
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,220
a long and incriminating history of rogue behavior,

886
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,170
corroborate a CIA narrative

887
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,350
that Hunt has snapped.

888
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,130
And that his search for Lark is nothing but a cover

889
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,990
to hide the fact that Lark...

890
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,500
Is me.

891
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,380
I've got to hand it to you, Ethan.

892
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,010
Normally, when people refer to you as your own worst enemy,

893
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,770
it's just a figure of speech.

894
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,640
I'm afraid Sloane's got some questions for her as well.

895
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,460
The Widow offered her up at no extra charge.

896
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,640
And where did Sloane get this information?

897
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,520
She didn't say.

898
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,840
She did, however, grant me the opportunity to bring you in,

899
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,060
on the condition that I terminate this mission

900
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,550
and hand over Solomon Lane personally.

901
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,810
- Sir, you can't do that. - Hunt.

902
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,550
I know Lane. And he has no intention of going back.

903
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,120
That's why we're taking him back.

904
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,300
Which means that's exactly what he wants us to do.

905
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,540
- Ethan... - Sir, what do you

906
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,570
think this is? A coincidence?

907
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,880
That someone just happened upon this?

908
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,430
Lane had it sent to her. He knew how she would react.

909
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:30,480
Just like he knew the Widow would turn us in.

910
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,670
Don't you see?

911
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,060
This, sir...

912
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:35,160
This is the trap.

913
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,040
- We are being directed. - Hunt!

914
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:40,010
Sir, there are still two plutonium cores in the wind!

915
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:42,440
And you lost them!

916
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,090
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

917
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:50,100
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

918
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,420
So making excuses for him is your full-time job now?

919
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,320
Good God, Ethan, don't make this any harder than it already is.

920
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,370
I can no longer protect you, don't you understand that?

921
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:03,210
This is as close as you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

922
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:05,180
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

923
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:08,410
I believe I've been given a choice to protect you or the IMF,

924
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,480
which is why I'm bringing you in.

925
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,730
And if I refuse?

926
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,710
What do you think he's here for?

927
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,410
You think he's some observer?

928
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,790
He's an assassin!

929
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,560
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

930
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,350
You go rogue, he's authorized to hunt you down

931
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:25,310
and kill you.

932
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:31,230
It's the job. No hard feelings.

933
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,080
Accept it, Ethan.

934
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,460
You've lost this one. What's done is done.

935
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,430
No, sir. No.

936
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:42,650
I am not asking you. I am giving you a direct order.

937
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,230
This mission is terminated.

938
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,050
Now!

939
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,320
Stickell, he's your friend.

940
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,200
Would you please talk some sense into...

941
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,240
I'm sorry, sir, but you left me no choice.

942
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,630
There's 15 minutes before we meet the Widow.

943
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,070
You want the plutonium, we're the only ones who can get it for you.

944
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,320
You in or out?

945
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,070
In.

946
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,370
What are you doing?

947
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,670
Benji needs to get ready.

948
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,660
- No, Ethan... - There's no time, Luther.

949
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,100
I need you to trust me.

950
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:33,510
You all right?

951
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,250
Yeah, I just...

952
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,470
got a bad feeling about this one.

953
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,190
If you don't hear from us...

954
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,260
I'll do it my way.

955
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:12,670
Don't take your eyes off him.

956
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,520
Enough games. I'm taking you out of here.

957
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,800
Where's Hunt?

958
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,540
He's gone to the meeting, with a copy of you.

959
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,740
Calm down.

960
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,640
Call the Apostles. Warn them.

961
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,260
I have no way of contacting them.

962
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,980
For their safety and mine.

963
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,840
What I do have is an extraction team with

964
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,200
satellite overwatch and a prearranged rendezvous.

965
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,600
They'll know as soon as we leave the building.

966
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:10,100
No, I'm staying here.

967
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,160
I haven't finished with Hunt yet.

968
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:20,050
Why did you have to make this so fucking complicated?

969
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,070
I don't understand what you mean.

970
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,550
The deal was simple.

971
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,740
I help you frame Hunt, you give me the plutonium.

972
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:29,010
You're wasting time.

973
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:32,160
"There cannot be peace without first a great suffering.

974
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:35,360
"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."

975
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,490
When I wrote those words,

976
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,800
I wasn't referring to your peace

977
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,800
or Hunt's suffering.

978
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,300
The old world order needs dismantling,

979
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,200
and we have the tools to dismantle it.

980
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,890
All you seem to care about

981
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:49,640
is that Hunt lives to take the blame.

982
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,260
That's not anarchy.

983
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,900
That's revenge.

984
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,480
Yes, it is.

985
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,320
And when I have what I want,

986
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,080
the Apostles will give you the plutonium.

987
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,900
Hunt's the only friend you've got.

988
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:06,810
You're only alive today

989
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,790
because he didn't have the guts to kill you.

990
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:09,990
Sloane was right.

991
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,720
The IMF is Halloween.

992
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,840
Nothing but grown men wearing...

993
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,380
What?

994
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,820
It's just the job.

995
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,500
No hard feelings.

996
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,550
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

997
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,810
And you were doing so well up until then.

998
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,120
Now, I think this one's loaded.

999
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,900
You want to find out?

1000
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,520
So, how'd I do?

1001
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:33,040
I never had a doubt.

1002
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,380
I'm beginning to see why you guys enjoy this so much.

1003
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,970
Hats off, Mr. Secretary.

1004
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,640
The man's a natural.

1005
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,190
Welcome to the team, sir.

1006
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,710
You're making a mistake.

1007
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,170
No, the mistake was mine

1008
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,350
when I saved your life over Paris.

1009
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,810
This proves nothing.

1010
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:51,910
I'm playing a role,

1011
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:54,220
just like you are, trying to recover that plutonium.

1012
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,560
That doesn't explain why you gave Sloane the dossier

1013
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,000
and tried to frame Hunt.

1014
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,600
He makes a good point,

1015
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,170
Lark.

1016
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,800
He's paranoid. Delusional.

1017
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:05,640
Just like the dossier says.

1018
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,500
So where did Sloane get the dossier from?

1019
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,340
I have no idea.

1020
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,920
I do.

1021
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:15,380
Did you get all that, Erika?

1022
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:16,660
I did.

1023
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:19,860
I don't appreciate being used, Walker.

1024
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,970
Oops. Bad boy.

1025
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,860
Where would you like him delivered?

1026
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:27,440
I'll come to you.

1027
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:32,530
Nobody move! Nobody move!

1028
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,200
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

1029
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:36,770
Hands in the air! Weapons down!

1030
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,820
Drop it! Drop it!

1031
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:40,840
Weapons down! Right now! You!

1032
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,920
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

1033
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,670
I thought we had a deal.

1034
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:48,350
We did. And now we don't.

1035
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,870
There is too much at stake here for me to take any chances.

1036
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,970
I'm bringing you all in, along with Walker.

1037
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,630
The plutonium is still out there!

1038
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,440
And I don't trust a living soul in that room to get it.

1039
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,400
We'll sort out who's who in Washington.

1040
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,890
- Erika! - Sir?

1041
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,930
It's all right. Let's just do what she says.

1042
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:11,600
The only real threats are in this room, and we have them.

1043
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,600
Do you?

1044
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:17,810
Go.

1045
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,200
Where the hell is Lane?

1046
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,440
Ethan! Ethan!

1047
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,340
First team is down. Send backup.

1048
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:41,620
Sir!

1049
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,410
Oh, no, no, no. Man down! Man down!

1050
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:48,920
Somebody help!

1051
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:59,040
Sir.

1052
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,190
Ethan, I tagged Walker, but he's on the run.

1053
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,510
You got to get him.

1054
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,560
Go.

1055
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,640
I'm sorry, sir.

1056
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:19,930
Go.

1057
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,750
Ethan?

1058
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,160
Wait!

1059
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:40,400
Get that son of a bitch.

1060
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,420
Come on, come on, come on.

1061
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,800
Yes! I got him.

1062
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,930
I'm sorry.

1063
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,780
Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?

1064
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,050
He's about a quarter mile west if you turn right.

1065
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,570
To my right?

1066
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:35,850
I can't do that.

1067
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:37,480
Why not?

1068
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,790
Because I'm being followed.

1069
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:41,580
What do you mean? By who?

1070
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,930
How do I know? CIA, Apostles...

1071
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:45,160
What difference does it make?

1072
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:48,610
Okay, okay, just get out of there and then go right.

1073
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,920
I am terribly sorry.

1074
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,400
Excuse me.

1075
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:18,120
Why is he running in circles?

1076
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,940
Okay, you need to cross the street on your left as soon as you can.

1077
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:54,730
Ethan, did you copy?

1078
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,960
Left, go left, now!

1079
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:57,340
I'm working on it.

1080
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,670
Now go across the street right in front of you.

1081
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:20,890
Ethan, he's getting away from you! You're gonna have to go faster.

1082
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,300
You're gaining on him! Go straight.

1083
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:58,570
Straight? Keep going straight?

1084
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,430
Go straight, go straight, straight, straight.

1085
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,350
Okay, now turn right.

1086
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:04,550
Right?

1087
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:06,490
Now?

1088
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,350
- Yes, right! - Are you sure?

1089
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:09,600
Yes, I'm...

1090
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,810
No, it's left! Turn left!

1091
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,600
Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.

1092
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:18,670
Left.

1093
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:23,140
Thank you.

1094
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,340
What are you waiting for?

1095
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:33,240
I'm jumping out a window!

1096
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,040
What do you mean, you're jumping out of a...

1097
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,070
Sorry. I had it in 2D.

1098
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,240
Good luck.

1099
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:17,090
At the end of the bridge, turn left. You've almost got him.

1100
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,960
Come on, come on, come on. Come on, Ethan, get him!

1101
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,320
You're right on top of him!

1102
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:40,780
That's it, he's right in front of you!

1103
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:42,290
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1104
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:19,490
You can't do it, can you?

1105
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,760
Not until you get your plutonium.

1106
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:25,570
No. He still has plans for you.

1107
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,800
You're gonna turn yourself in and admit you're John Lark,

1108
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:32,960
then watch the old world implode from your dark little cell.

1109
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,670
And if I don't?

1110
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,770
I'm her guardian angel, Hunt.

1111
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,570
If I see you again, she dies.

1112
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:56,480
If you try to warn her, she dies.

1113
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,450
Know when you're beat.

1114
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,390
These are the designs we recovered

1115
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,570
from Dr. Delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1116
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,910
That's a five-megaton nuclear device.

1117
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:18,670
That's greater than all the explosive energy released in World War II.

1118
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:22,250
To disarm it, normally we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1119
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,000
What, "normally"?

1120
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,200
Walker and Lane have two plutonium cores,

1121
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,550
meaning two bombs.

1122
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,770
Yeah. And they're both linked by a microwave fail-safe

1123
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:32,840
which is accurate to within one-tenth of a second.

1124
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:36,960
Any attempt to defuse one bomb automatically triggers the other.

1125
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,430
Meaning once armed, the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1126
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,030
The countdown is started by a remote detonator,

1127
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,940
which is also a fail-safe.

1128
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,290
Meaning once the countdown starts,

1129
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,450
it can't be stopped.

1130
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,390
So the solution to this is?

1131
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,940
We're working on it.

1132
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,700
So,

1133
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,210
technically, this is a suicide mission.

1134
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,080
What is it?

1135
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,620
Have a seat. Please.

1136
01:40:21,650 --> 01:40:24,020
In all the years that I've known Ethan,

1137
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,760
he's only been serious about two women.

1138
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,420
One was his wife.

1139
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,750
He's married?

1140
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,730
No, he was.

1141
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,010
Was? What happened to her?

1142
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:40,660
Well, she was taken by some people who wanted to get to Ethan.

1143
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:43,550
It's okay, he got her back in one piece.

1144
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,890
Then he quit the game.

1145
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:48,880
They were happy for a while.

1146
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,340
But every time something bad happened in the world,

1147
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,950
Ethan would think, "I should've been there."

1148
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:57,760
And she would wonder, "Who's watching the world

1149
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:59,850
while Ethan's watching me?"

1150
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:03,490
Deep down, they both knew that someday, somehow,

1151
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:06,320
something truly terrible was going to happen

1152
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,230
all because they were together.

1153
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:12,570
So...

1154
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,300
Where is she now?

1155
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,750
She's a ghost.

1156
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,180
Good at it, too.

1157
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,120
Taught her myself.

1158
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,790
Every now and then, she sends up a signal

1159
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,900
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1160
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:27,630
And that keeps him going.

1161
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:30,770
Why are you telling me this?

1162
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:35,600
We're in this mess

1163
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:37,980
because Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1164
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,140
He...He's a good man.

1165
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:46,370
And he cares about you more than he can admit.

1166
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:51,070
That's one more worry than he can handle right now.

1167
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,740
If you care about him,

1168
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:58,080
you should walk away.

1169
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:02,640
Luther...

1170
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,440
Is everything all right?

1171
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:18,230
I'm coming with you.

1172
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:28,550
I know.

1173
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,210
So how do we find him?

1174
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:37,340
Microwave transponder.

1175
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:40,310
Traceable via satellite anywhere in the world.

1176
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,890
Lane had one of these in the back of his neck.

1177
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:44,740
We removed it in Paris.

1178
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:47,000
At the same time, we put our own transponder in.

1179
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:47,920
Got it.

1180
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:52,380
36-hour delayed activation,

1181
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,910
in case Lane's Apostles scan him.

1182
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,810
So you planned on letting him go.

1183
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,860
Not this way, but yes.

1184
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:02,050
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.

1185
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,600
How can you be sure?

1186
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,800
His plan to put me in prison went to hell.

1187
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:09,410
Now he's gonna want me there for the end.

1188
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:11,250
So when does this transponder activate?

1189
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,800
I got him. I got him, I got him, I got him!

1190
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,190
He's traveling east over Europe at 500 knots.

1191
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:16,290
He's airborne.

1192
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,100
Shall we inform the CIA?

1193
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,690
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1194
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,010
I don't trust anybody outside of this room.

1195
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,010
We're gonna have to go it alone.

1196
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,690
So where do we go?

1197
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:50,130
How we doing, Benji?

1198
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:53,030
If there's a way to defuse these bombs, I can't find it.

1199
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,460
You'll figure it out. I know you will.

1200
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:59,410
Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.

1201
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:01,780
Lane must've found our transmitter.

1202
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:02,990
What's his last position?

1203
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:05,280
At about 30 miles northeast.

1204
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:07,260
Then that's where he wants us to go.

1205
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,410
- What's there? - The Nubra River Valley.

1206
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:11,160
There's only a medical camp there.

1207
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,650
Humanitarian Aid Overseas.

1208
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,790
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

1209
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,740
Smallpox.

1210
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,340
- What? - Smallpox.

1211
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:23,880
The Apostles triggered a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

1212
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,800
Lane must've wanted that camp there for a reason.

1213
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,190
But what?

1214
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:29,720
Oh, my God.

1215
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,950
What is it?

1216
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:34,940
The Nubra River is at the base of the Siachen Glacier.

1217
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:36,480
So a nuclear blast there would irradiate

1218
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:39,910
the largest natural irrigation system in the world.

1219
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:44,680
Fresh water from the border of China to India and Pakistan.

1220
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:48,220
They're gonna starve one-third of the world's population.

1221
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,740
"The greater the suffering..."

1222
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:51,690
"the greater the peace."

1223
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:53,600
I still don't understand

1224
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:55,280
why Lane wants a medical camp there.

1225
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,680
It doesn't matter.

1226
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:59,590
All that matters now is we find a way to defuse those bombs.

1227
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:01,170
I think I've found it.

1228
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,560
Maybe.

1229
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,550
Look, there appears to be a flaw in the bomb's operating system.

1230
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:08,060
The remote detonator requires that firing key.

1231
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:11,080
If we remove that key, then it should short out the fail-safe

1232
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,060
and allow us to cut both fuses.

1233
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:14,940
So one of us needs to get the detonator

1234
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:16,400
- and remove that key. - Yeah.

1235
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:19,320
While the rest of us cut the fuses on both bombs.

1236
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,360
Simple.

1237
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:21,890
Yeah, but...

1238
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,470
But what?

1239
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,900
Well, in order to make this work,

1240
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:28,170
we can't remove the key or cut the fuses

1241
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:30,880
until after the countdown starts.

1242
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:33,230
But wait, just so I've got this clear.

1243
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:35,910
Our only chance to safely defuse both bombs

1244
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:38,370
is to let the countdown start.

1245
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:41,230
And then remove that key.

1246
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:50,970
Okay.

1247
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:12,110
Both devices are now connected to the detonator.

1248
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,370
Fifteen minutes should give you enough time

1249
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:17,700
to reach minimum safe distance.

1250
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:22,140
My running days are over.

1251
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,940
This is where it ends for me.

1252
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:55,820
I'm getting signals all over the place.

1253
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,210
We're at a medical camp.

1254
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,330
X-ray machines, CAT scanners,

1255
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:01,290
radiological signatures everywhere.

1256
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,510
It's like a needle in a haystack.

1257
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,460
Process of elimination, one at a time.

1258
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:06,590
Let's split up. Stay on comms.

1259
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:18,140
Ethan?

1260
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:25,040
Julia?

1261
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:31,010
Is that...

1262
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:36,570
Julia!

1263
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,620
Does he know?

1264
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:44,590
This is my husband, Erik.

1265
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,760
This is...

1266
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,380
Rob. Rob Thorne. Dr. Rob Thorne.

1267
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:51,030
- I worked with Julia... - At Mass General.

1268
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:52,230
Before New York.

1269
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:53,370
You're kidding.

1270
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,650
- What a coincidence! - I know. I...

1271
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:57,580
- What brings you all this way? - I was, uh...

1272
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:59,580
I was in Turtuk, not far from here

1273
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,560
and heard help was needed.

1274
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,560
Actually, we're just about finished here.

1275
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:08,400
The whole village is inoculated. But, um...

1276
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:10,880
What were you doing out in Turtuk?

1277
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,720
Rob's on vacation.

1278
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:15,920
No. No, I'm... I'm working.

1279
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:19,560
You're a long way from home.

1280
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:22,650
Yeah, yeah. Thanks to our guardian angel.

1281
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,020
Guardian?

1282
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:25,670
Well, yeah. We were running a field hospital

1283
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,210
outside of Darfur when the outbreak happened here.

1284
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:31,320
And here comes this phone call from an anonymous donor, out of the blue.

1285
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:34,330
And he says he's ready to underwrite the entire operation.

1286
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,680
One condition.

1287
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,950
We run the whole thing.

1288
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,780
Can you believe that?

1289
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:42,320
I certainly can.

1290
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,520
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1291
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,900
Out of the blue.

1292
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:49,800
That's quite a full life.

1293
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:52,240
Yeah, you know, before Julia, I never traveled.

1294
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,910
I never even left New York.

1295
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:55,340
Never left the hospital.

1296
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:58,400
Seven days a week, dusk till dawn. No vacations.

1297
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:00,130
Ethan, I think I found something.

1298
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:02,230
I was on the fast track to be Chief of Surgery at 50.

1299
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:03,500
Heart attack at 55.

1300
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:06,650
And she convinced me to let it all go.

1301
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,930
Help where it's needed most.

1302
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,150
So we've been on the go ever since,

1303
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,250
and I've never been more fulfilled.

1304
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,880
I'm happy for you.

1305
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,220
Thank you.

1306
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,220
Well, we should get going.

1307
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:23,520
We have a lot of packing to do.

1308
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:25,580
Oh, no, I'll handle that. You two should catch up.

1309
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,310
Oh, no, I should get out of your hair.

1310
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:29,580
Are you kidding? You should stick around.

1311
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:31,930
I'm just sorry you came all this way for nothing.

1312
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,630
Tell you what, we'll pack,

1313
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,650
and why don't we give you a ride back to Turtuk,

1314
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,160
you two can catch up in the car? Yeah?

1315
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:43,150
You're very kind.

1316
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,270
Settled.

1317
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,690
See you soon.

1318
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:49,710
It was good to see you.

1319
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:53,900
I am so sorry, Julia. I'm so sorry.

1320
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:16,920
Take both helicopters.

1321
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,650
No one else leaves.

1322
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:29,360
Careful, careful, careful.

1323
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:35,240
It's armed.

1324
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:36,880
But the countdown hasn't started yet.

1325
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,740
The network signal's strong, which means the other device

1326
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,410
is close by and the detonator.

1327
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:42,890
About half a K in that direction.

1328
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:45,560
They're still here.

1329
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,070
Luther, you keep working on it.

1330
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:49,430
You two, come with me.

1331
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,080
Sure. I got this.

1332
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:55,590
Don't worry about old Luther.

1333
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,880
Walker.

1334
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,830
Damn.

1335
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,130
Ethan, the countdown has started!

1336
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,500
We have 15 minutes.

1337
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:41,970
Walker has the detonator.

1338
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:53,670
Come on, come on!

1339
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:57,190
We have to evacuate these people.

1340
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,140
There's no time.

1341
01:51:58,190 --> 01:52:00,700
This whole valley's gonna be incinerated in 15 minutes.

1342
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:05,710
It's too late!

1343
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,650
No.

1344
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:08,690
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1345
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,700
- What? How? - I'll figure it out.

1346
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,570
Find Lane! Find the other bomb!

1347
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:17,340
- What the hell is he doing? - I find it best not to look.

1348
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:53,980
How we doing, Luther?

1349
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,100
Tripwires everywhere. I don't have enough hands.

1350
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:57,200
Just make it happen.

1351
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,140
Where's Ethan?

1352
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,690
He's gone after the detonator.

1353
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,520
Wait, where's the detonator?

1354
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,370
Luther.

1355
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,350
Julia.

1356
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,610
- You shouldn't be here. - Oh, my God.

1357
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,620
Oh, my God.

1358
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,030
Is that what I think it is?

1359
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:49,590
Luther, get her out of there!

1360
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:51,330
Where is she gonna go?

1361
01:53:53,310 --> 01:53:54,570
What can I do?

1362
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:58,790
In the kit, the pliers with the red grip.

1363
01:53:58,850 --> 01:53:59,940
Are you insane?

1364
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,720
Mind your business, Benji.

1365
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:03,300
This is my business!

1366
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,520
Benji, do you copy?

1367
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:48,530
Ethan!

1368
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:49,730
Ethan, where are you?

1369
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,540
I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1370
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:52,540
Hold on.

1371
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,920
How did you get in the helicopter?

1372
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:55,350
What, you can fly a helicopter?

1373
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,560
Did you say helicopter?

1374
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:58,510
What the hell are you doing in a helicopter?

1375
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:00,230
Just... Hey, hey...

1376
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,800
Did you find the other bomb?

1377
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:02,880
We're still looking,

1378
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,290
but finding the bomb is not gonna matter

1379
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:05,490
unless we have the detonator.

1380
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:07,720
I know. I know. I'll get it. I'll get it!

1381
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,020
Uh, if he's in another helicopter,

1382
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,750
how are you gonna get it?

1383
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:12,880
I'll figure it out.

1384
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:14,690
You find the bomb, I'll get the detonator.

1385
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,150
I won't let you down.

1386
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:18,830
I won't let you down.

1387
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,610
- Be ready. - Look, Ethan. Ethan!

1388
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,230
Ethan, come in!

1389
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:26,590
Benji? Benji? Luther?

1390
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:28,600
Anybody?

1391
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,910
I can do this. I can do this.

1392
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,900
What do we got here?

1393
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,680
We've got airspeed.

1394
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,400
Airspeed.

1395
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,240
Okay, power. This is power.

1396
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:48,230
Payload. How do I get rid of this payload?

1397
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:58,250
Power.

1398
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,800
Wire strippers.

1399
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,230
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.

1400
01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:17,730
Sorry, the thing with the green grip.

1401
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:19,670
- Got it. - The wire in my left hand.

1402
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:21,520
- The black one? - My left hand.

1403
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:24,030
- That's your left hand. - Sorry, the other wire.

1404
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:24,780
The red one?

1405
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:26,640
Yes, the red one in my right hand.

1406
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,980
Just checking.

1407
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:29,760
Oh, I like her.

1408
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:44,600
Hold this for me, will you?

1409
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:48,180
Holy shit!

1410
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,100
Damn it!

1411
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:56,450
Get up there!

1412
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:07,670
That's right, prick.

1413
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:18,060
Oh, shit!

1414
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:25,960
Son of a bitch.

1415
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:30,040
All right.

1416
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:40,250
Whoa, whoa, too much. Too much.

1417
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,200
Oh, shit!

1418
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:45,240
Pull up. Pull up.

1419
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:49,010
Terrain. Terrain. Pull up.

1420
01:58:49,130 --> 01:58:50,030
Pull up.

1421
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,250
I'm trying, I'm trying!

1422
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,540
Terrain. Terrain.

1423
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:12,310
Benji, I'm not finding anything.

1424
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:14,200
I think we're looking in the wrong place.

1425
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:15,750
Signatures everywhere.

1426
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:17,230
This is the perfect place to hide it.

1427
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:18,680
That's the point. I know Lane.

1428
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:20,420
If we're looking here,

1429
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:23,090
it's because he wants us to.

1430
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:27,250
I'm heading to the village.

1431
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,880
Just wait for me, all right?

1432
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,630
Ilsa, I think I've found something.

1433
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,570
Cut this wire right here.

1434
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:45,600
Turn that screw counterclockwise, very slowly.

1435
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:46,950
Got it.

1436
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,080
So...

1437
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:53,130
How is he?

1438
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,490
Oh, you know.

1439
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,320
Same old Ethan.

1440
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,880
Jesus!

1441
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,680
Oh, shit!

1442
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:13,610
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1443
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:23,050
Benji, I see Lane.

1444
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:24,590
What? Where?

1445
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,150
He's in a house at the edge of the village.

1446
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:27,970
All right, just wait for me, okay?

1447
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:30,010
Ilsa, wait for me!

1448
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,120
No.

1449
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:47,690
Nuclear bomb.

1450
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,680
Damn it!

1451
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,530
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1452
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:46,560
Ilsa, where are you?

1453
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:47,810
I'm in a house...

1454
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:12,860
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1455
02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:14,390
You're out of your mind!

1456
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:16,540
I don't know what's down there.

1457
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:22,240
Pull up, pull up!

1458
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:34,530
This crazy son of a bitch is trying to ram us!

1459
02:02:34,630 --> 02:02:35,910
Go!

1460
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,030
Shit!

1461
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,700
Benji, come in.

1462
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:57,070
We're almost at the fuse.

1463
02:02:57,130 --> 02:02:59,430
We need to find that other bomb now.

1464
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,220
Did you just say "other bomb"?

1465
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:03,580
Benji, do you read me?

1466
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,070
I'm working on it!

1467
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,030
Ilsa, where are you?

1468
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:26,910
You can't stop it.

1469
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,600
Do you understand?

1470
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:30,430
There's nothing he can do.

1471
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,760
When the clock runs out,

1472
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:34,200
Ethan Hunt will lose everything

1473
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,380
and everyone he ever cared about.

1474
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:42,240
Ilsa!

1475
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:43,410
Benji!

1476
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:44,410
Benji!

1477
02:03:44,490 --> 02:03:46,070
Ilsa, where are you?

1478
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:49,500
You don't want to see this.

1479
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,230
Benji!

1480
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:54,190
- Ilsa! - Benji!

1481
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,500
Benji! Benji, stop!

1482
02:04:25,330 --> 02:04:26,750
Benji!

1483
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:54,660
Oh, no, no, no!

1484
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:35,450
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1485
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,750
No, no. Not when I'm this close.

1486
02:05:40,830 --> 02:05:42,180
Come on, come on!

1487
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:29,370
Thank you.

1488
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:30,750
Tie him up.

1489
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:36,970
Why won't you just die?

1490
02:08:58,580 --> 02:09:00,660
There's nothing else you can do.

1491
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:04,240
Go be with your husband.

1492
02:09:05,450 --> 02:09:06,840
Luther...

1493
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:08,550
Go.

1494
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,240
Benji, where are you?

1495
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:25,100
Okay, Luther, we're inside. Tell us what to do.

1496
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:27,600
You should see the red wire attached to the motherboard.

1497
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:28,130
Yeah.

1498
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:32,170
You need to cut that and the green wire next to it simultaneously.

1499
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,610
Okay, ready?

1500
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:35,550
Set. Go.

1501
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,960
I told you. It can't be stopped.

1502
02:09:40,070 --> 02:09:41,920
There's nothing you can do.

1503
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:00,880
Benji, listen.

1504
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,090
Turn the screw counterclockwise.

1505
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:04,210
Yep.

1506
02:13:05,230 --> 02:13:06,940
Remove that panel and you'll see

1507
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:09,230
the power and ground wires for the fuse.

1508
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:09,940
Got it.

1509
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,230
When the time comes, cut the green wire.

1510
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:13,640
Do not cut it yet.

1511
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:14,980
Okay. We copy.

1512
02:13:20,380 --> 02:13:23,120
Ethan, if you can hear me, we're ready to make the cut.

1513
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:25,080
Ethan, come in.

1514
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:28,250
Benji, how do we know if he's got the key?

1515
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:29,690
He'll get it.

1516
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:31,010
Yeah, but how do we know?

1517
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,650
He'll get it done!

1518
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:40,510
We're out of time. We just have to hope he has it.

1519
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:42,720
- Okay, we're ready. - At two seconds we cut.

1520
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:44,380
Wait, wait, wait! Why two? Why not one?

1521
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:45,550
You want to cut it that close?

1522
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,960
It's a second we'll never get back.

1523
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:48,390
When? Can we make a decision on this?

1524
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:49,650
All right, all right! We'll do it on one.

1525
02:13:49,690 --> 02:13:50,380
Cutting on one?

1526
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:52,150
Yes, one. All right, stand by.

1527
02:13:54,450 --> 02:13:55,710
Three...

1528
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:56,980
Two...

1529
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:57,710
One.

1530
02:13:57,770 --> 02:13:58,900
Now!

1531
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,280
Okay.

1532
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,030
My man.

1533
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:39,330
Ethan?

1534
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:42,840
Ethan?

1535
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:45,640
Can you hear me?

1536
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:50,580
Can you hear me?

1537
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:56,150
No. Don't, don't, don't.

1538
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:58,270
Don't try to move.

1539
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:01,190
Don't move. You're pretty banged up.

1540
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:05,630
You're a lucky man.

1541
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:08,280
It's a miracle that crash didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1542
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:10,310
If your friend didn't find you an hour later,

1543
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:11,860
you would've died of exposure.

1544
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:13,710
- My friends? - Yeah.

1545
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,540
She got here not long after you left.

1546
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,410
Right in front of half the Indian Army.

1547
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:24,320
Can you give us a few minutes, please?

1548
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:28,550
See you later, Doc.

1549
02:16:34,970 --> 02:16:36,370
Julia...

1550
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:39,280
I'm sorry.

1551
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:41,390
There's no reason to be sorry.

1552
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:42,490
No.

1553
02:16:42,590 --> 02:16:44,180
I'm sorry

1554
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:47,730
for everything. I...

1555
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:50,510
Look at me.

1556
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:52,720
Look at me.

1557
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:54,720
Look at my life.

1558
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:00,000
I love what I do, and I never would have

1559
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:02,170
found this if I hadn't met you.

1560
02:17:02,570 --> 02:17:07,130
And everything that happened, it taught me who I am.

1561
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:11,330
It showed me what I am capable of, and I...

1562
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:13,680
I am a survivor.

1563
02:17:14,310 --> 02:17:16,200
But what happened here,

1564
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:19,290
- it was my... - Nothing happened.

1565
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:21,430
Because you were here.

1566
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:27,150
And I sleep soundly at night knowing you always will be.

1567
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,450
You're happy?

1568
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:39,020
Very.

1569
02:17:42,090 --> 02:17:44,540
I'm exactly where I should be.

1570
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,520
And so are you.

1571
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:29,600
Per your request,

1572
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:34,580
I'm handing Solomon Lane back to MI6.

1573
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:41,120
Through a broker, of course.

1574
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:45,990
Part of our ongoing arrangement.

1575
02:18:51,130 --> 02:18:53,380
After what happened in Paris,

1576
02:18:53,870 --> 02:18:56,660
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1577
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:03,030
And that closes your friend's account with British Intelligence.

1578
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:07,520
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1579
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:11,180
I understand now why Hunley believed in you.

1580
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:14,480
The world needs the IMF.

1581
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:17,240
We need people like you

1582
02:19:17,370 --> 02:19:19,630
who care about the one life

1583
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:23,070
as much as they care about the millions.

1584
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:28,010
That way I never have to.

1585
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:30,320
You okay?

1586
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:33,210
You've never looked better.

1587
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,220
Don't. Please.

1588
02:19:36,210 --> 02:19:37,700
How close were we?

1589
02:19:40,510 --> 02:19:42,070
The usual.

1590
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,170
The usual?

1591
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:50,920
Please don't make me laugh.
